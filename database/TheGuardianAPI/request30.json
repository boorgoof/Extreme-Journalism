A group of leading academics has joined green pressure groups and others in demanding greater transparency. The justification process is required by the European Union as a high-level assessment to ensure the benefits of new-build nuclear stations outweigh potential detriments. The academics, part of the Nuclear Consultation Group (NGC), have written to the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) calling for an inquiry, not least because the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has made himself the final authority in the justification of new power stations, even though he has voiced support for building more atomic reactors. Paul Dorfman, an academic at Warwick University and a spokesman for the NGC, said: \"Given that justification, once finalised, may foreclose on any future discussion on issues crucial to nuclear power, it is vital that this process is opened up in order to allow for meaningful and realistic examination of evidence [in] a public forum. \"Because the justification of new nuclear power in the UK represents a key issue for trust in governance concerning energy policy and the control of radiation risk, we believe the government should hold an independent inquiry,\" he added. The NCG, which is supported by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, argues that justification must be \"thorough, transparent, neutral and independent\". Some academics are considering legal action against the government if it fails to change the procedure. They are encouraged by a successful challenge by Greenpeace in the high court, which ruled that an earlier consultation on nuclear was lacking in independence. They also say the public feels that consultation over issues such as new runways at Heathrow is not genuine. The DECC said it was taking the justification process very seriously and did not accept that Miliband was compromised, but it left the door ajar to allow for a change of tack. \"There's an open consultation under way and thus far we don't believe there's also a need for an inquiry, but we'll keep that under review,\" a spokesman said. \"The secretary of state's role in it is perfectly reasonable and he'll approach it in an open-minded and fair manner.\" The NCG argues that once the justification process is over it becomes difficult to reopen major policy issues. The crowded schedule, however, means decisions may be rushed, it says. The government is in a hurry over nuclear because of a perceived \"energy crunch\" after 2015 when many old reactors will be out of service, coal-fired plants will be closing and North Sea oil will be running down fast. EDF and other firms say they can build new atomic stations by 2017 but only if decision are not delayed. The NGC is critical of many of the Nuclear Industry Association's arguments, dismissing claims that atomic power is low-carbon, a vital part of the energy mix and a domestic resource. The NGC believes that concentrating on wind, solar and wave projects could be a better strategy, while also noting nuclear power is dependent on uranium from overseas. The atomic industry is attacked for having \"very high\" opportunity costs and will suck investment out of renewables. It cites the example of AMEC selling off its wind energy subsidiary to put its efforts into Sellafield nuclear site, where it has just become a joint manager. Dorfman and his colleagues, who also include Professor Keith Barnham from Imperial College and Professor Gordon Walker from Lancaster University, say nuclear has a history of cost over-runs at the expense of the taypayer, noting the financial problems of British Energy and the £80bn cost of cleaning up atomic waste."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/sep/25/how-process-uranium-enrichment-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-25T22:39:14Z","webTitle":"The science of uranium enrichment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/25/how-process-uranium-enrichment-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/sep/25/how-process-uranium-enrichment-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"The science of uranium enrichment","bodyText":"Gas centrifuges are used to enrich uranium to make either fuel for nuclear reactors or fissionable material for nuclear weapons. To make enough fuel for a commercial reactor takes tens of thousands of centrifuges, which must be connected together and timed to run simultaneously. Raw uranium ore as dug from the ground contains less than 1% Uranium-235, the type of uranium atom that can easily be split to produce energy. The rest is a heavier form, Uranium-238. Enrichment plants produce either low enriched uranium for nuclear power plants, which contains around 5% Uranium-235, or high enriched uranium for nuclear weapons, which contains 85%-90% Uranium-235. Processing begins with uranium ore, which is milled to produce a compound called 'yellow cake'. This is converted into uranium hexafluoride gas, which is pumped into a gas centrifuge and spun around at high speed. The heavier gas molecules, containing Uranium-238, are drawn to the outer wall, while the lighter gas molecules, containing Uranium-235, collect in the middle. From here, the enriched gas can be siphoned out. Connecting thousands of centrifuges together creates what nuclear engineers call a \"cascade\". Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz was upgraded to house 8,000 gas centrifuges earlier this year, and is eventually due to contain 50,000 devices. But in two years of operation, the site has produced little more than 1500kg of low enriched uranium. The country's nuclear plant in Busher needs a supply of around 20,000kg of nuclear fuel every year. \"In terms of producing a commercially viable, commercial scale enrichment facility, it makes absolutely no sense from either a technical or an economic point of view to have a small facility in a mountain with 3,000 centrifuges in it,\" said Jacqueline Shire, an analyst at the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington DC. \"If you need to produce nuclear fuel for a reactor, you need tens of thousands of centrifuges running. If you want to produce bomb-grade material potentially, you only need 3,000,\" she added. Another analyst said the facility could be a research and development centre, or a hardened store to protect nuclear enrichment equipment away from the more vulnerable Natanz facility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/dec/03/ed-miliband-attack-tory-climate-saboteurs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-03T20:09:51Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband attacks Tory climate 'saboteurs'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/03/ed-miliband-attack-tory-climate-saboteurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/dec/03/ed-miliband-attack-tory-climate-saboteurs","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband attacks Tory climate 'saboteurs'","bodyText":"The climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, launched a ferocious attack on Conservative politicians who have cast doubt on the science of climate change in the run-up to the global UN summit in Copenhagen. He said the former chancellor Nigel Lawson and former shadow home secretary David Davis were irresponsible and were acting as \"saboteurs\". Miliband's comments follow articles from both men in the wake of the publication of emails hacked from the University of East Anglia's Climate research unit (CRU), which sceptics claim reveal wrongdoing by prominent climate scientists. \"It is profoundly irresponsible for people like Nigel Lawson, who has held high office, and David Davis to be doing what they are doing. It is very dangerous. People sabotaging the [Copenhagen] process deserve the name saboteur,\" Miliband said. \"There are interests who do not want an agreement at Copenhagen. Anyone who comes forward at this moment and starts saying 'we can stick our heads in the sand' is irresponsible.\" Davis wrote in the Independent that the Earth appeared to be cooling, not warming, and that the leaked emails seemed to show leading scientists \"conspiring to rig the figures to support their theories\". But this was dismissed by Miliband. \"This is scientific consensus from around the world. It's as universal a view as you can get. One chain of emails does not undo scientific consensus.\" UEA announced that an independent review into the row over the leaked emails would be conducted by Sir Muir Russell, a physicist and former senior civil servant. The university said the inquiry would look at the key allegations, including whether the leaked exchanges between the scientists demonstrated any manipulation or suppression of data, the CRU's approach to assembling and presenting research findings and whether the department complied with freedom of information requests. Bob Ward, at the London School of Economics and one of the prominent voices who called for a review, welcomed the news: \"This appears to be a very good appointment. One concern is that the results may not be published until the spring. This is probably necessary to allow a thorough investigation, but it does mean that those who are using 'climategate' as a propaganda tool for their own political ends might be able to enjoy many more weeks of mischief-making.\" The publicity surrounding the leaked emails has brought the sceptical views of other Tory politicians into the limelight, including Peter Lilley and several backbenchers. Last week two Conservative MEPs voted against a motion calling for 80% carbon emission cuts by 2050, while last year a poll asked MPs if humans were to blame for climate change: 35% of the Conservative MPs responding said no, or don't know, compared with 12% for Labour and 4% for the Liberal Democrats. David Cameron has faced claims this week that the green policies that have featured prominently in the repositioning of the party do not have broad support. \"David Cameron might cycle for the cameras – but his party is chugging off in the other direction in a fleet of gas guzzlers,\" said Miliband.Cameron also suffered embarrassment this week due to an overly green statement from prospective parliamentary candidate Zac Goldsmith, who told the Guardian that no new nuclear power stations would be built under a Conservative government. Tory policy is that Britain needs new nuclear reactors to ensure energy security and to cut carbon emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/mar/16/nuclear-power-renewables-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-16T14:39:59Z","webTitle":"Green lobby and nuclear groups clash over role of renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/16/nuclear-power-renewables-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/mar/16/nuclear-power-renewables-edf","fields":{"headline":"Green lobby and nuclear groups clash over role of renewable energy","bodyText":"EDF and E.ON have warned the government they may be forced to drop plans to build a new generation of nuclear power plants unless the government scales back its targets for wind power. The demands – contained in submissions to the government's renewable energy consultation – reinforces the worries of wind developers that the two sectors cannot thrive simultaneously. EDF of France and E.ON of Germany, two of the most high-profile nuclear supporters, said attempts to reach 35% of electricity generated by renewables is not only unrealistic but also damaging to alternative schemes such as nuclear plants. \"The deployment of high levels of intermittent renewables for electricity generation will require the construction of additional carbon-emitting plant as back-up for when renewables are not available to meet demand,\" EDF argued. \"This is likely to be predominantly gas-fired and will therefore undermine efforts to reduce dependence on non-domestic fuel sources.\" \"A 25% electricity target will provide the best platform for further decarbonisation of electricity generation in the period beyond 2020, through a combination of further renewables, new nuclear and coal and gas with carbon capture and storage.\" The attempt to dilute the contribution from renewables has infuriated the environmental lobby. \"We've always said that nuclear power will undermine renewable energy and will damage the UK's efforts to tackle climate change – now EDF agrees,\" said Nathan Argent, head of Greenpeace's energy solutions unit. \"The National Grid shows that there is capacity to take well over 30% percent of our electricity from renewables. EDF are trying to block efforts to deliver on the most important technology to the UK to tackle climate change and keeps the light on in order to protect their own vested nuclear interests.\" Friends of the Earth agreed. \"The UK is the windiest country in Europe with the best wave and tidal resources,\" said Andy Atkins, the group's executive director. \"We should be maximising renewables and harnessing as much of that clean, safe energy as we possibly can – not propping up the French nuclear industry. \"Nuclear power is no green alternative – it leaves a legacy of deadly radioactive waste that remains dangerous for tens of thousands of years. And nuclear power plants simply cannot be built in time to deliver the cuts in carbon dioxide emissions that science says are needed.\" E.ON said it was wrong to interpret the submission as an attempt to dismiss wind power completely. A spokesman said the company had already built a raft of wind farms in Britain and had plans for more. \"We believe in a mix of power sources, including nuclear and renewables, but we know that during the cold spell in January that some of wind farms were operating at less than 10% of capacity.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/15/ed-miliband-renewable-wind-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-15T20:26:38Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband committed to wind energy despite pressure from nuclear sector","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/15/ed-miliband-renewable-wind-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/15/ed-miliband-renewable-wind-energy","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband committed to wind energy despite pressure from nuclear sector","bodyText":"Ed Miliband today promised to meet \"over 30%\" of Britain's green energy targets with wind and other renewable energy sources by 2020, but for the first time his Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) opened the door to that figure being revised downwards. Miliband denied he was rowing back on previous commitments to hit 32%, and said concerns over the intermittent nature of wind – that turbines could be idle in the wrong kind of weather – \"were not as significant as others say\". But the executive summary of the UK renewable energy strategy spells out official fears that the increase in wind generation \"could have implications for the security of the electricity supply\". It goes on to say that these issues can be overcome in a variety of ways. \"We will continue to keep these issues under close review, and take any necessary action to ensure this continues to be manageable,\" states the document. These words will feed the worries of renewable power company executives, who told the Guardian their contacts with civil servants had led them to believe ministers were in danger of being influenced by nuclear and other power sectors, and this could lead to a downward revision of wind electricity goals. That scepticism fed into a strategy paper published by the Confederation of British Industry on Monday, which called on the government to drop its wind targets to 25% and boost nuclear power instead. Wind energy currently provides less than 6% of Britain's electricity, while other clean technology sectors such as solar and tidal produce almost nothing. Miliband said a target of more than 30% was \"stretching\", but he also denied there was any great difference between the government and the CBI over aspirations for wind and tidal power. Meanwhile, the energy secretary definitively turned his back on another demand from the CBI: that nuclear power should be given financial help, perhaps through a floor being put on the carbon price. Miliband made clear he wanted to see the building of new atomic reactors, but said it was up to the private sector to deliver that. Tinkering with the carbon price was neither appropriate nor necessary, he said. Nuclear provides 13% of the UK's power for generating electricity, and under the UK low carbon transition plan that will drop to 8% by 2020. Ministers appear to acknowledge that only a small number of new plants will have opened by 2020 to work alongside the few remaining older facilities such as Sizewell B in Suffolk. The rest of Britain's electricity is to be produced by gas, clean coal, renewables and \"other sources\". The British Wind Energy Association said it was delighted that Miliband had \"rightly ignored the siren calls to abandon wind as the driving force for reaching the [low carbon] targets\". The Nuclear Industry Association said tonight it was equally happy to see ministers acknowledging the vital role that atomic energy played. \"Nuclear is currently the largest source of low-carbon electricity in the UK and it is vital that its place in our generating mix is maintained it we are to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets.\" The government is also hoping to meet its wider carbon reduction targets by the extensive use of clean coal, in which carbon emissions are captured and stored. This technology has been talked about for many years as a way of preventing greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere, instead pumping them into disused North Sea oilfields. Ministers repeated their commitment to fund up to four demonstration models in the UK, and will establish a special office of carbon capture and storage. They expect a first prototype CCS plant to be up and running in 2014 while also pushing ahead with other green power schemes such as the Severn barrage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/17/queens-speech-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-17T16:46:39Z","webTitle":"Clean coal cash and protection for Antarctica expected in Queen's speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/17/queens-speech-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/17/queens-speech-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Clean coal cash and protection for Antarctica expected in Queen's speech","bodyText":"Money for \"clean coal\", improved flood defences and tougher protection of the Antarctica wilderness are expected to be the key environmental components of the government's legislative agendain tomorrow's Queen's speech. The latest energy bill is designed to help the UK move towards a low-carbon economy. It will include a £9.5bn levy on electricity suppliers to fund four demonstration carbon capture and storage (CCS) coal power plants. The \"CCS Incentive\", as the levy is known, was announced last week by energy secretary Ed Miliband as he outlined plans to fast-track major energy infrastructure projects such as coal plants, nuclear power stations and windfarms. Currently only two of the four demonstration projects, those from Scottish Power and E.ON, are proceeding to the next stage of the CCS competition. Professor Stuart Hazeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh and CCS expert, recently claimed the government's competition to build to such demonstration plants was \"dead on its feet.\" Shadow energy secretary Greg Clark last week said he supported Miliband's energy plans, but criticised the government for delays on energy policy that had led to a \"last minute scramble.\" He also said industry figures had suggested the CCS competition was likely to be delayed from its 2014 deadline for active demonstration plants. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat shadow energy secretary, said he was disappointed that measures on energy efficiency are not expected to be part of the bill. \"If you insulated every home properly in Britain it would be equivalent of taking all the cars of Britain off the roads. What the country needs is a united policy to deliver a warm home for every household,\" Hughes said. The flood and water management bill is designed to improve the UK's resilience to future flooding threats that are likely to be intensified by climate change. The government is expected to continue implementing the recommendations of Sir Michael Pitt's report following the 2007 floods, which called for a better spread of information in the event of flooding and clearer guidelines on which local and government agencies take responsibility. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, called for the government to get \"serious\" about flooding: \"It's clear for anyone to see, that despite their protestations, the government still has a huge backlog of flood relief works in many parts of the country. If the government is serious about reducing the risk of flooding, they have to step up their efforts to front load investment in flood relief schemes in high risk areas across the country.\" The Antarctica bill is part of an international effort to bolster protection for the region as the number of scientists and tourists visiting it increases. It is part of a legal framework to make visitors to the continent pay to clean up any pollution they create. The bill will update the Antarctic Act 1994 and implement further protection under the UN's international Antarctic treaty into UK law. It will require UK Antarctic operators to take preventative measures to reduce the risk of environmental emergencies. • Additional reporting by Felicity Carus"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/oct/01/iran-nuclear-geneva-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-01T12:29:42Z","webTitle":"Nuclear talks lead to rare meeting between US and Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/01/iran-nuclear-geneva-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/oct/01/iran-nuclear-geneva-talks","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear talks lead to rare meeting between US and Iran","bodyText":"Senior American and Iranian officials today held one-to-one talks in Geneva during negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme, marking the most substantive bilateral contact between the two countries for 30 years. The meeting between the American diplomat William Burns and the Iranian official Saeed Jalili came during a lunch break at the Geneva meeting. It was unclear what the two men discussed, but the encounter had been planned in advance by the US state department in the hope of breaking a four-year impasse over Iran's nuclear activities. One official described the meeting as a \"significant conversation\". A western diplomat said there were no breakthroughs at the morning session but Iran had begun to discuss the nuclear question under concerted pressure from diplomats of six major powers. He said the session began with both sides restating earlier positions. Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, said Iran was within its rights to pursue a peaceful nuclear programme and suggested the negotiations focus on broader, global themes. The six-nation group made up of the US, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China said it would stick by the \"freeze for freeze\" offer put forward last year, under which the UN would impose no new sanctions and Iran would stop expanding its uranium enrichment programme. Iran has so far rejected a further offer of economic aid and technical assistance in establishing a more proliferation-proof nuclear power industry if it suspends enrichment altogether. The talks extended into the early evening, taken by some analysts as a positive sign. Iran's Press-TV said further talks were planned before the end of October, but this could not be independently confirmed. This morning the six-nation group, known as the E3+3, agreed the discovery of a previously undeclared uranium enrichment plant made a resolution to the crisis \"all the more urgent\", the diplomat said. The group has insisted that Iran name a date for UN inspections of the plant, near the city of Qom. Western powers say that if the talks fail they will look at wide-ranging sanctions aimed at damaging the Tehran regime. The talks are taking place in an 18th-century lakeside villa. All the E3+3 group have sent top diplomats, with the exception of China, which has sent a relatively junior official, the head of the foreign ministry's department of arms control and disarmament.

According to IAEA statistics, at the height of new nuclear build in the mid-1980s, 65 reactors were commissioned in two years, and the average number built between 1977 and 1993 was 16.6 a year, not 3.4 as claimed by the Oxford Research Group. Known resources of uranium are sufficient to sustain the current rate of use for 50 years, and estimated reserves would be sufficient for 200 years. However, rises in uranium prices and demand increase the incentive for exploration and extraction, and current estimates underestimate future uranium availability. Moreover, since 1985 40% of annual uranium requirements have been met from dismantling nuclear warheads, reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons. A recent study by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development identified a global need for 1,000 large nuclear stations by 2050 alongside fossil-fuelled technologies with carbon capture and storage, and a large-scale expansion of renewables, to meet the rising demand for electricity while protecting the planet from climate change. Given strong political direction and market incentives, the global nuclear industry could respond once again to a large expansion of nuclear capacity to meet the urgent need for reliable, large-scale, low-carbon electricity. Keith Parker Chief executive, Nuclear Industry Association A further point not fully spelled out in the Oxford Research Group report is that the total volume of primary nuclear energy available in the ground, even with recycling of uranium in fast-breeder reactors, is far less than the total remaining untapped in fossil fuels. Even if it were a clean, safe energy source and it was technically feasible to shift to nuclear on a large scale; even on a theoretical model of complete conversion from fossil fuels to nuclear - including conversion to electric motor vehicles - it would supply our energy requirements for a shorter period than the remaining fossil fuel reserves can. Moreover, new fast reactors depend upon plutonium production, a slow process that would take centuries to enable full conversion from fossil to nuclear fuel. Renewables are the only solution. Mark Ackary London Impracticality of a large programme and nuclear proliferation are not the only reasons why nuclear power must remain at most a marginal contributor to non-fossil electricity generation worldwide. For most of the developing world, the long lead times and huge upfront capital investment make nuclear an impossible option as a principal generating resource.

The industry is trying to shake off an image built on fears of radiation leaks and waste spills, but as a relatively low-carbon source of energy, it is being seen as a viable green alternative. If working on a nuclear plant doesn't appeal, radiation expertise is needed in healthcare and in the oil industry. Expect high graduate salaries. An employer says ... Chris Ball, director of nuclear, Atkins www.atkinsglobal.com We work on some of the biggest challenges in the UK. There is a variety of work, too - such as commissioning and decommissioning old stations. We are looking for people who are smart thinkers. We have so many challenges on our hands we need people who are able to think a bit differently. It's a booming industry so it's important people have drive and motivation to want to take things on, otherwise we will hold back our own growth. I joined the company in 1994 and it's fair to say that for many years you wouldn't get many people coming through the industry. We've never really struggled to recruit, but we had to be proactive then. What's become evident lately is more graduates are coming to us who have researched the industry well. There has been a shift in attitudes. The vast majority of graduates have engineering or science backgrounds, which are not necessarily nuclear-related - there aren't many nuclear courses out there. We have our own training academy and we tend to bring in graduates with good degrees and train them. Some people will see working in the nuclear industry as doing their part to ensure we meet the environmental challenge, as it's a low-carbon source of energy. Others are keen to help build the next generation of generators. A university says ... Dr Paddy Regan, course director of the MSc in radiation and environmental protection, University of Surrey www.surrey.ac.uk If you want good graduates to come into the industry, having done a postgraduate or training course, you have to offer a financial incentive. When students leave university with £20,000 debts they are conscious of getting a reasonably well-paid job as soon as possible. Specialised training at master's or PhD level is an extra two to four years of study. A few years ago a number of us went to some of our industrial partners and said some mechanism was needed to fund our students to encourage them to do a master's and maybe make them more suitable for employment. There is now some money to cover at least tuition fees for some students and to give them some employment experience. We need to keep the pressure on government to provide more funding. At Surrey we have been running radiation-based training courses at master's level for over 30 years. There is a perception among students that there are jobs now. Four or five years ago there was a downturn because there was some concern about what would happen in the industry, but that has certainly changed. There is a wide spectrum of skills sets in the nuclear industry. It needs general plumbers, mechanics, physicists and engineers, but also the specialists. One in three people need some sort of cancer treatment and a large number are treated with radiation. The skills set you need for this is practically the same as what you need to work in the nuclear industry. We have two master's courses - an integrated MPhys four-year course, which includes a research year where students are placed in the industry and get a full salary. A significant number go on to do PhDs or to work where they are doing their placements. The other course is a traditional type. It's a one-year course and students spend nine months in class and then three months doing research. We try to get them places in the industry. A graduate says... Matthew Lee, 23, member of the environment performance team, Sellafield Ltd www.sellafieldsites.com My job is to advise on any environmental issues that may come up and write risk assessments.

He's got an uphill battle ‑ we're all going to have to struggle.\" That sentiment - that Britain is on the brink of hard times - was echoed across the country over the last 48 hours, when the Guardian undertook a 168-mile journey from Witney to the Hallam constituency of the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, in Sheffield. The route through coalition Britain was from the gentle Cotswolds up to the hills of the Peak District, but in terms of public mood, it was a journey that went downhill. A new dawn of spending cuts and tax rises has begun, and people in middle-England counties such as Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire are bracing themselves. Few people seem to query the need for drastic spending cuts. But the further one travels away from Cameron's constituency, the more support for his government appears to be wavering. In the summer of 1997, the upbeat mood of the nascent Labour government was summed up in Tony Blair's electoral slogan that \"things can only get better\". The opposite is true of the country under Cameron and Clegg, where the consensus, if there is one, is that things are almost certainly about to get worse. On the trip the most optimistic voters were found in the first 20 miles of country lanes that meander out of Witney, past hamlets like Barnard Gate, Hampton Poyle and Weston-on-the-Green. There are few public services to cut in these tiny villages; the only evidence of the new era of frugality are the speed cameras, abandoned by Oxfordshire council to save money. The roads led to a field north of Oxford, where several hundred locals had gathered for the Bicester and Finmere show, an annual event to raise money for spinal injury charities. Patrons came in wellies and tweed, despite the sunshine, for an event that boasted a foxhound parade, warm beer and the chance to place a £1 bet on the dubiously titled gambling game \"ferret in a bin\". There was a sense here that after 13 years of perceived neglect of rural England under Labour, the time for the countryside had finally arrived. And it was Cameron, who during the election campaign spoke fondly of fox and rabbit hunting during his childhood, who people said they instinctively trusted. Repeal of hunting ban \"The Labour government abuses the countryside,\" said Nick Reynolds, 45, a local farmer. \"The Conservatives look after it, in a nutshell.\" He was among a majority expressing concern that the Lib Dems would \"water down\" Tory policies in the coalition, not least the commitment for a free vote on the repeal of the hunting ban. Roy Herring, 66, from the haulage yard across the road and the proud owner of a 1916 steam tractor, was Bicester's equivalent of a heretic. \"I think maybe the Lib Dems will hold the Conservatives back a bit, which isn't a bad thing,\" he said. Expressing an opinion that was to be repeated at almost every stop between Oxfordshire and South Yorkshire, he added: \"Vince Cable is the one that shines for me.\" Britain is being governed by two parties that claim to have overcome their differences, but it is not hard to find division among its people. One such battle was brewing later in the afternoon, 50 miles north, on the outskirts of the village of Meriden, near Coventry. As evening fell, locals gathered under a marquee in their continuing battle to turf out their new Gypsy neighbours who, five days before the general election, occupied a secluded piece of green-belt land they had purchased with trailers. The timing of the invasion, as locals call it, was no coincidence. Under Labour, Traveller communities tended to be favoured in planning disputes. That is now changing. Eric Pickles, the communities and local government secretary, wants to revive elements of the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act that turned trespass from a civil into a criminal offence. His ministers have already reversed incentives for local authorities to make land available for Gypsy sites, and cut funding. All bids to fund new sites and refurbish existing ones across England and Wales have been cancelled. All this is met with approval by Meriden's Residents Against Inappropriate Development (Raid), the group that oppose the Gypsy site. They have elected a former Lib Dem councillor as chairman and – without a hint of irony – constructed their own makeshift camp along the lane leading up to the Gypsy site. A dozen fold-up chairs surround a gazebo with fairy lights, log fire and television, from where they take turns to maintain a 24-hour watch on the Gypsies. Doug Bacon, 44, a retired pest controller and the group's spokesman, said: \"The community really has gelled together. This is not about hating Gypsies - it is purely about saying this development is not appropriate.\" Across the hedge, Noah Burton, 45, a scrap metal trader and de facto leader of Meriden's Gypsy community, described himself as one of the coalition's \"losers\". He and the 10 other families who want to live on the land are seeking retrospective planning permission, but fear that Britain under the coalition government is becoming hostile toward people on the margins of society. Cracks in support But even Burton expresses a surprising sympathy for the challenge for the coalition. \"I don't know where we're going to end up. But for the country in general, I think the government are doing the right thing with these cuts,\" he said. \"It's going to be very hard, and people will need to stand on their own two feet, but in the long run we're going to be a lot stronger for it.\" Not everyone agrees. North along the A38 dual carriageway, green fields give way to terrace houses, and the first cracks in support for the government begin to show. Derby sits in the middle of Britain, and contains a three-way marginal constituency which Labour held during the election with just 500 votes, despite a swing to the Tories. There are pockets that seem to share the government's vision of a self-starting society less reliant upon the state. In Normanton, a deprived borough, a group of Muslim parents have already raised £100,000 to set up a primary school under education secretary Michael Gove's free school initiative. But most parents expect the state to provide for their children's educational needs, and Derby was one of the main casualties of the coalition's decision last month to scrap Building Schools for the Future, a £55bn school building programme. A total of £231m was pulled from 14 out of 18 school building projects in the city, many of which were due to begin as soon as Christmas. \"As a Conservative, it is a devastating blow,\" said Evonne Williams, the city council cabinet member for children and young people. \"People have started pointing the finger and saying: 'it's your government, apologise'.\" The M1 leads to the place with the most visceral anger towards Westminster. It is, ironically, the home of the chief architect of the first coalition government since the second world war. In contrast to the Cameroons of Witney, it is a struggle to find anyone willing to publicly back Nick Clegg in his constituency of Sheffield Hallam, where one in three jobs are dependent on public funding. It has not been a good three months for Clegg, his party, or it seems, his constituents. An £80m government loan for Sheffield Forgemasters, promised by Labour in March to enable the company to manufacture components for nuclear power stations, was one of the earliest victims of spending cuts. In addition, the shelving of a £13m grant to redevelop a former steelworks in the city along with a £600m project to regenerate the centre of Sheffield have left it like an abandoned victim of the coalition efficiency drive. On a recent constituency visit to Ecclesall infant school fete, Clegg was berated by three constituents in front of shocked schoolchildren. One father came in a T-shirt emblazoned with the message: \"Nick Clegg ‑ Sheffield will remember Forgemasters.\" \"He's not liked at the moment,\" said Chris Weldon, a 50-year-old former steelworker and Labour councillor. \"A lot of it comes down to people having lived through the 1980s. We lost 100,000 jobs in this city in about four years, and anyone who lived through that will be worried now.\" Two miles across the the city, around 30 young people had gathered at the town hall to protest against local authority cuts. Many had been brought up in local authority care, and demanded a meeting with officials over plans to slash the budget of Sheffield Futures, an agency that provides advice and support to young people. The local authority argues it is only passing on cuts imposed by central government, which have reduced its payment of area-based grants directed at deprived communities. \"I've not had the best start in life,\" said Augusta Wilson, 24, her voice trembling. \"If they take this away it feels like they're setting me up to fail.\" She pledged to take the fight to central government, and \"that Nick Clegg\". \"He's not very popular around here, you know,\" she added. \"Except with himself.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/jul/24/nuclearpower.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-23T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Energy: Nuclear clean-up industry in chaos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/24/nuclearpower.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/jul/24/nuclearpower.energy","fields":{"headline":"Energy: Nuclear clean-up industry in chaos","bodyText":"Chaos at the heart of Britain's nuclear clean-up industry has been laid bare by an internal government audit after embarrassing cost overruns and bureaucratic bungling. The Department for Business admits there are \"inherent risks\" associated with the financial affairs of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) that forced the department to find £400m from other budgets to balance the books. It also admits that budgetary problems were exacerbated by misunderstandings, unminuted meetings and lack of sufficiently trained staff. In response to a critical report by MPs about its handling of the NDA, the department (BERR) reveals that 42% of its budget is already being pumped into the NDA, which admitted last week its total future clean-up cost estimates were now £10bn higher than 12 months ago at £73bn. The job of overseeing the NDA has been moved from BERR's energy group to its shareholder executive in an attempt to tighten up accounting while the NDA has sent its finance staff for retraining at the National School of Government run by the civil service, the report reveals. The operational failures of the Thorp and Mox fuel recycling plants at Sellafield in Cumbria are known to be largely responsible for wiping millions of pounds of expected income off the NDA's budget, leaving it to seek more cash from government. \"The fact that the funding gap anticipated was met in part by using all of BERR's end year flexibility illustrates the extent to which the department is vulnerable to movements in the NDA's budget caused in large part by the reliance on volatile commercial income,\" says BERR in its report - \"NDA budgeting shortfall 2007-8 lessons learned\" - which was quietly slipped out through a parliamentary website this week. The document, a response to a business and enterprise committee inquiry, reveals that the NDA and the Treasury were at cross-purposes over some aspects of the clean-up agency's budget and decisions taken at a vital meeting as far back as February 2006 were misunderstood. These problems were exacerbated by the lack of proper procedures at those talks. \"There is no formal record of that meeting, nor was there subsequently any correspondence that confirmed what those present believed to have been agreed,\" the BERR report says. \"To minimise the risk of misunderstandings in the future, all parties have acknowledged the importance of a written record of all material decisions and future actions.\" The report also says that the government is looking at whether changes are needed to help the NDA manage its budget more effectively. It admits the \"commercial income [from Thorp and Mox] is volatile and over time will decline as sites progressively close and move into the decommissioning phase\". Greenpeace was scathing about the latest revelations. \"Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse we find out that the people in charge of dealing with Britain's radioactive waste have adopted chaos theory as a business model,\" said Ben Ayliffe, senior nuclear campaigner at Greenpeace UK. \"The NDA's failure is as much a failure of government, who set up the authority knowing it would have to rely for half of its income on failing nuclear plants. The same government that brought us this shambolic funding system is now telling us it can deliver new nuclear without subsidy. No one can take this claim seriously on the basis of this latest nuclear farce we're witnessing.\" The government has switched money meant for low-carbon and renewable technologies to clean up the waste from nuclear power stations. Figures released by BERR in February showed that at least £15m that was meant to be used on \"sustainable energy capital grants\" had been switched to the NDA. Ministers also plundered the defence budget as well as cash that should have been used for \"regional selective assistance\" to bolster the NDA. BERR said some money had been switched in the spring supplementary estimates for 2007-08 but insisted this was a technical matter to balance the books on paper. The NDA's budget problems have also caused conflict with the Environment Agency, which argued that insufficient funds had been made available by ministers for the clean-up of certain sites. The NDA was accused of making things worse by deciding to concentrate on especially toxic waste at sites such as Sellafield.This prioritisation will delay clean-up elsewhere, the Environment Agency argued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/feb/08/tehrans-nuclear-programme","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-08T23:00:01Z","webTitle":"Tehran's nuclear glue | Meir Javedanfar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/08/tehrans-nuclear-programme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/08/tehrans-nuclear-programme","fields":{"headline":"Tehran's nuclear glue","bodyText":"Iran's nuclear programme was started under the Shah. He wanted the bomb to transform Iran into a Middle East superpower. For many Iranians, however, the real need for nuclear armament was most keenly felt after Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and civilians during the eight-year war between the two countries in the 1980s. Iranians felt helpless, at the mercy of the Butcher of Baghdad and without any way to deter him – with barely a whimper of criticism heard from the west against his abuses of international law. As someone who lived then in Iran, I remember those days vividly. One of my Muslim friends however, saw me, his Jewish neighbour, as his protector. Why? As far as he was concerned, Saddam did not care about killing Muslims. But Saddam would think twice before risking the death of thousands of Jews by dropping chemical weapons on Tehran, my friend reasoned, because Israel could obliterate him in response. The sense of irony and pride that my Shia Muslim friend felt protected because my family were living near him in a Tehran neighbourhood has never left me. Today, numerous Iranians are all for nuclear technology in order to produce electricity to meet their country's 8% annual increase in demand for energy. Although their country has abundant gas and oil supplies, they would prefer to export it and use the income to develop their country's infrastructure. But do not imagine that thinking underpins the Iranian leadership's latest call, on Sunday, to accelerate enrichment of its uranium stockpile. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's main motivation for following the current nuclear policy is to keep Iran isolated. The thinking among Tehran ultra-conservatives is that by raising the ire of the west and keeping Iran isolated from the rest of the international community, it will be easier for them to crack down against opposition at home. Khamenei's second priority is his hope that, once Iran becomes a nuclear power, nobody would dare attempt regime change from the outside. With the leadership sensing mounting pressure, more than ever it wants to pursue the nuclear programme. To Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, this programme is one of the only examples of progress made under the revolution. As the 31st anniversary approaches, and Iranians look at their country, they see that in a majority of cases it has gone backwards. It is a poorer country. Corruption is more common. Increasing numbers of educated Iranians prefer to leave their country. They carry the third most worthless currency in the world, while getting foreign visas with an Iranian passport has become an even more miserable experience. The nuclear programme remains the one area where the government believes it can show progress. With everything else in such a sorry state, trumpeting its success has become an important tool in claiming support and legitimacy. There is also the question of longevity of the revolution. Iran's refusal to accept the terms of the recent deal offered by the international community – which called for Iran to first ship 75% of its uranium abroad, and then to receive it back in the form of nuclear fuel – has more to do with domestic politics. Khamenei is worried that such a deal would boost Obama's image in Iran. The reality of a black US president with the middle name Hossein has neutralised years of claims by the post-revolution Iranian government that America is a racist, anti-Islamic state. Unhelpfully for Khamenei, the name Obama can also be pronounced as oo–ba–ma, meaning \"he is with us\" in Farsi. All these factors have endeared the US more than ever to the people of Iran. The last thing Khamenei wants is to boost America's image by reaching a deal; in doing so his regime could lose the anti-American glue that it increasingly relies on to hold it together. Sunday's announcement is unlikely to be the last; many more such provocative policies should be expected from Tehran in the coming months. The more threatened the regime feels internally the more it will try to provoke the west. Although the west, especially Israel, has every right to feel threatened, it would also do well to remember that it faces a weakened regime, which is losing legitimacy every day, and is beset with infighting on an unprecedented scale. The response, where possible, should be measured. Although sanctions seem inevitable, they should target the regime. And if President Obama is looking for a double blow, he should also remove sanctions against the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, which are making life very difficult for Iranians. Improving the image of the west among ordinary people, while singling out the rulers, is a double punch which the regime could find extremely difficult to recover from. Perhaps more so than a military attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/mar/16/wave-and-tidal-power-scotland","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-16T18:06:00Z","webTitle":"Ten sites named in £4bn UK marine energy project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/16/wave-and-tidal-power-scotland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/mar/16/wave-and-tidal-power-scotland","fields":{"headline":"Ten sites named in £4bn UK marine energy project","bodyText":"The heavy Atlantic swell and some of the world's strongest tides are to be harnessed by a breakthrough scheme to generate clean marine energy off northern Scotland, with predictions it will rival the output of a nuclear power station. The crown estate and Scottish government today unveiled a £4bn project to build 10 wave and tidal power sites around the Orkney islands and the Pentland Firth, with the potential to power up to 750,000 homes. The devices deployed will include the Pelamis \"sea snake\", which uses the undulations of the sea surface to generate power, and the SeaGen tidal machine, which looks like an underwater wind turbine. In total, the machines will be able to produce up to 1.2GW of \"green\" energy, more than Dungeness B nuclear station in Kent. The crown estate, which owns all the UK's seabed out to 12 nautical miles, said these projects were the world's first commercial wave and tidal power schemes. It is expected to announce new marine power sites in other parts of the UK later this year. Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said the announcement confirmed his prediction that the Pentland Firth region – where the north-east Atlantic meets the North Sea – would become the \"Saudi Arabia\" of marine energy. The narrow sea channel has some of the most powerful currents and tidal surges in the world, with speeds up to 16 knots or 19mph recorded. The area also experiences some of the biggest waves in the UK. Crown estate officials and the developers accepted these often dangerous waters posed significant engineering and safety challenges for the firms involved. Salmond said some estimates suggested the waters could release up to 60GW of power – 10 times Scotland's annual electricity usage. Other studies suggest one-third of the UK's total electricity needs could be met by tidal power alone. \"This is a huge milestone on the way to making that dream a reality,\" Salmond said. \"Today marks a major milestone in the global journey towards a low carbon future, with the commercial-scale deployment of marine renewables set to power our economies and help safeguard the planet for generations to come.\" The schemes are expected to cost £4bn to install, and will require up to £1bn of extra investment – from public sources – to build new national grid connections, harbours and other infrastructure in Orkney and Caithness. The 10 projects, several of which have already had investment from a £22m UK government marine energy fund, are evenly divided between wave and tidal power stations, with each type generating up to 600MW. The projects are being shared by three of the UK's largest power firms, E.ON, Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), which already operates the UK's largest hydro schemes, and Scottish Power Renewables, a heavy investor in windfarms. In most cases, the utility companies have formed joint ventures with four of the UK's leading marine energy firms, covering small areas of sea with up to 200 machines. They use a variety of techniques to capture the energy of the ocean. Edinburgh-based company Pelamis Wave Power, whose sea-snake device is now being tested off the coast of Portugal, will have its own 50MW site in the Pentland Firth and share three other sites with SSE and Scottish Power on the west coast of Orkney's main island. Its new devices will each be 180 metres long and generate 750kW of electricity. Also to use wave power is a more powerful version of Aquamarine's existing Oyster machine, in which a lever hinged at the ocean floor is pushed back and forth. It will be used for a 200MW station with SSE Renewables, and its 200 new 1MW machines are expected to start producing power by 2015. OpenHydro, a large underwater turbine resembling a jet engine and bolted to the sea floor, is built by Cantick Head Tidal and will harness the firth's fierce tides at a 200MW site south of Orkney. Another tidal machine, SeaGen, features two underwater propellers attached to a tall column anchored to the seabed. It will be installed by Marine Current Turbines off Orkney and at a 100MW site north-west of John O'Groats. SeaGen is currently on test at the \"narrows\" leading into Strangford Lough from the Irish Sea. The marine announcement follows last month's confirmation that £75bn will be spent developing a much larger amount of offshore wind power – at least 25GW – at nine sites around the British Isles, including two off Scotland. The several government projects are intended to increase the UK's renewable energy output, in a bid to cut the emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power stations and to increase the country's energy security, as North Sea oil and gas declines. Orkney islands' council is now planning to invest more than £20m to upgrade its harbours and port facilities to cope with the huge influx in industrial equipment, ships and workers involved in these projects, which will industrialise large areas of the coastline. The islands are widely admired for their tranquillity and scenery but Stephen Hagan, the council's leader, said he believed most residents were keen to see the investment. With other island councils in Scotland facing huge local unrest over plans for major onshore windfarms, he does not expect significant opposition on environmental grounds. \"I do genuinely think that people in Orkney feel that we have to get the balance right between the long term sustainability of the place and the environment. I think they see the development of marine renewables as a much better option than onshore wind,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/aug/10/scotland.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-09T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Scotland plans link to Norway power supply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/10/scotland.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/aug/10/scotland.energy","fields":{"headline":"Scotland plans link to Norway power supply","bodyText":"Scotland is drawing up plans to build the world's longest electricity connector - to Norway - to help meet its renewable targets and end its dependence on nuclear power. The whole project could cost more than £2bn. Jim Mather, the Scottish Executive's energy minister, will meet his Norwegian counterpart in October to discuss the proposal. The plan could raise the hackles of MPs already concerned about Scottish politicians' push for independence. The UK depends on Scotland for most of its oil revenues and renewable energy resource. Politicians in Westminster are worried that full Scottish independence would further undermine the security of the UK's energy supply. Scotland is much windier than England, Wales or Northern Ireland, and also has green hydro-electric power. It has set a target of getting half its electricity from renewable sources such as wind power by 2020, compared to the UK's goal of generating about a third from renewables. However, instead of building dirty coal plants to back up its wind farms, Scotland wants to connect to Norway's grid to solve the problem. Scotland's ruling party, the SNP, has committed not to build any new nuclear reactors. Norway gets almost all its electricity from hydro-power, which works by releasing water from a higher reservoir into a lower reservoir via a turbine which generates electricity. The water is then pumped back up to the higher reservoir for use later. If the 1,000km (620-mile) connector between the countries is built, when Scotland is windy and has surplus electricity, it would be exported to Norway to provide power to pump the water back up into its higher reservoirs. When the wind does not blow in Scotland and there is a shortage of power, Norway would activate its hydro-plants to make up the shortfall. This would solve the issue of wind power's intermittency, frequently cited by critics. Scotland wants to use the connector to provide power to North Sea oil operators. Drilling rigs and platforms use about four gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to the demand from about four cities the size of Birmingham. Currently, operators use expensive and dirty diesel generators or gas to power their facilities. Paul O'Brien, senior executive of government organisation Scottish Development International in Glasgow, said: 'Scotland has got to replace nuclear power. We realise there are issues over backing up renewables, but we don't want to use fossil fuel plants to do this. There is also a special opportunity to extend the life of the North Sea oil fields.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2007/may/23/nuclear.greenpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-23T14:17:34Z","webTitle":"Background: Nuclear power in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/23/nuclear.greenpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2007/may/23/nuclear.greenpolitics","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power in the UK","bodyText":"The government's position on nuclear power has evolved slowly but steadily towards its current standpoint: climate change and dwindling domestic energy resources mean there are few options but to build a new generation of nuclear plants. Britain was an early adopter of the technology and has had at least some of its electricity produced via nuclear reactors for more than half a century. However, while other nations have enthusiastically embraced nuclear generation - around three-quarters of French electricity is produced this way - Britain has been more tentative, with only around a fifth of its power being nuclear produced. Such has been the lack of investment in nuclear power, the government's energy white paper of February 2003 warned if no new plants were commissioned, or existing ones revamped beyond their planned life spans, by 2025 there would be only one nuclear plant still operating. That document was equivocal about the technology. Whatever the climate change arguments for nuclear power, the white paper concluded, \"its current economics make it an unattractive option for new, carbon-free generating capacity and there are also important issues of nuclear waste to be resolved\". However, while not immediately recommending new nuclear stations, the white paper added: \"We do not rule out the possibility that at some point in the future new nuclear build might be necessary if we are to meet our carbon targets.\" Less than three years later, the attitude had changed. A Department of Trade and Industry consultation document from January last year made it plain that ministers had been thinking further. While the government remained committed to sustainable targets, the energy minister Malcolm Wicks said in the introduction, \"the challenges we face in meeting them have been thrown into sharper relief\" through new evidence about climate change and a faster-than-expected fall in domestic oil and gas production. The time was now right to start \"looking again at nuclear power as well as other sources of energy\", he said. This position was firmed up in July 2006, when the industry secretary, Alistair Darling, told MPs that the government was indeed planning a new generation of nuclear power stations. \"The government has concluded that new nuclear power stations could make a significant contribution to meeting our energy policy goals,\" Mr Darling told the Commons, introducing the DTI's Energy Review. Tony Blair's introduction to the 218-page document set out his views clearly - domestic oil and gas were running out, he warned, and: \"Neither renewable energy nor greater energy efficiency can provide the complete solution to the shortfall we face.\" Britain must build a new generation of nuclear stations, Mr Blair argued, which would \"yield economic benefits in terms of carbon reduction and security of supply\". While the government has officially solicited outside views on the issue throughout this process, many believe this is purely for show and all the main decisions were finalised long ago. Nonetheless, ministers face potentially tough opposition, not only from environmental groups but also from MPs. In a letter published in today's Guardian, a group of Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs warn that \"we should not be politically panicked into accepting a technology that poses a continuing risk in terms of weapons proliferation and terrorism, produces a toxic waste for which no management solution is agreed, benefits from hidden subsidies and tends to undermine the prospects of renewable energy and efforts to increase efficiency\". The letter, also signed by Friends of the Earth, said it was a \"myth\" that the lights would go out or that Britain would be far less dependent on gas imports without nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/mar/31/barack-obama-drilling-offshore-approves","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-31T18:04:32Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama reverses campaign promise and approves offshore drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/31/barack-obama-drilling-offshore-approves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/mar/31/barack-obama-drilling-offshore-approves","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama reverses campaign promise and approves offshore drilling","bodyText":"Barack Obama took the Republican slogan \"drill, baby, drill\" as his own today, opening up over 500,000 square miles of US coastal waters to oil and gas exploitation for the first time in over 20 years. The move, a reversal of Obama's early campaign promise to retain a ban on offshore exploration, appeared aimed at winning support from Republicans in Congress for new laws to tackle global warming. Sarah Palin's \"Drill, baby, drill\" slogan was a prominent battle cry in the 2008 elections. The areas opened up are off the Atlantic coast, the northern coast of Alaska and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. However, in a concession to his environmentalist base, Obama did retain protection for Alaska's Bristol Bay, the single largest source of seafood in America and home to endangered species of whale. The Pacific Coast from Mexico to Canada is also off-limits. Obama said the decision to allow oil rigs off the Atlantic coast was a painful one, but that it would help reduce US dependence on imported oil. \"This is not a decision that I've made lightly,\" the president said. \"But the bottom line is this: given our energy needs, in order to sustain economic growth, produce jobs, and keep our businesses competitive, we're going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable, homegrown energy.\" He said the administration would take steps to protect the environment and areas important to tourism off the Atlantic, as well as sensitive areas in the Arctic, and added: \"Drilling alone cannot come close to meeting our long-term energy needs, and for the sake of the planet and our energy independence, we need to begin the transition to cleaner fuels now.\" Interior department officials said the areas opened up today are thought to contain the equivalent of three years' annual US useage of recoverable oil and two years' worth of natural gas. Under the proposals, a vast swath of Atlantic coast from northern Delaware to central Florida, including about 167m acres of ocean, would be open to drilling. An additional 130m acres of ocean in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska could also open up for drilling following environmental assessment studies. About two-thirds of the eastern Gulf of Mexico would be open for exploration though the plan would bar rigs within 125 miles of the Florida coast. The state of Virginia could see drilling within 50 miles of the coast, and could issue its first licences as early as next year. However, actual drilling would probably not get underway for years. Drilling would be off-limits throughout the US Pacific coast. Bristol Bay in south-western Alaska would also be off the table until 2017. Today's speech was widely seen as an attempt by Obama to use last week's epic victory on health reform as a springboard for other items on his agenda. He combined the announcement with a renewed appeal to Democrats and Republicans in Congress to pass climate change legislation. The laws would be a huge step forward towards a global deal but has encountered fierce domestic opposition. A small group of Democrats and Republicans are expected to produce proposals to cut the US's mammoth greenhouse gas emissions, in the coming weeks. But the proposals are unlikely to go as far as environmentalists would like. The interior secretary, Ken Salazar, made a significant declaration today, saying the administration had renounced the concept of carbon cap and trade. This system, seen by many as efficient and effective, sets a gradually reducing limit to emissions and then allows polluters to buy and sell permits to emit greenhouse gases, but opponents argue it would damage the economy. \"The term cap and trade is not in the lexicon anymore,\" Salazar told CNBC television. The go-ahead for drilling is also a bitter disappointment for environmentalists and Democrats. That could make it even more difficult to stitch together a compromise proposal on climate change in the Senate. Last week, 10 Senators from coastal states, including those now opened up for drilling, issued a letter expressing concern that offshore exploration would hurt fishing and tourism industries. Maryland's Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, a supporter of Obama's climate agenda, said: \"We know spills happen with offshore drilling. It happens even with the most responsible drilling.\" Greenpeace saw the announcement as a betrayal of Obama's campaign promise, with director Phil Radford saying: \"This act furthers America's addiction to oil.\" Oceana called it a \"wholesale assault\" on the seas. Brendan Cummings, senior counsel at the Centre for Biological Diversity, said: \"Today's announcement is unfortunately all too typical of what we have seen so far from President Obama – promises of change, a year of 'deliberation,' and ultimately, adoption of flawed and outdated Bush policies as his own.\" The disappointment could lift on Thursday, as Obama said his administration would then finalise more rigorous fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. The White House will also buy 5,000 new hybrid vehicles for the federal fleet. Today's drilling decision further consolidates Obama's position in the middle ground between industry and environmentalists. Environmentalists have been disappointed with the president's decisions to restrict – but not ban outright – the highly destructive practice of blowing up mountaintops to mine thin seams of coal. Obama indicated in his state of the union address that he was ready to offer two key concessions to Republicans – lifting the ban on offshore drilling and supporting new nuclear power plants – to try to gain support for climate change and energy legislation in Congress. He took the first step last month, spurring the first construction of new nuclear plants since the Three Mile Island leak 30 years ago, by announcing $18bn in loan guarantees for two new nuclear reactors. As a presidential candidate, Obama had repeatedly attacked his opponent, John McCain, for suggesting drilling would lower gas prices, arguing that it would take several years and billions in investment before those areas became productive. But as the summer of 2008 wore on with prices spiking at the pump, Obama along with other Democrats began moderating their opposition to offshore drilling. Democrats in Congress did not renew an annual ban on offshore drilling, and Obama began reversing his opposition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2007/sep/20/highereducation.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-20T01:20:18Z","webTitle":"Public fed biased information on nuclear power, says academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/20/highereducation.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2007/sep/20/highereducation.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Public fed biased information on nuclear power, says academic","bodyText":"An academic observer of Britain's nuclear consultation has said that information given to the public was biased and incomplete, casting fresh doubt on whether the the government has followed a court ruling to present both sides of the argument. Paul Dorfman, senior research fellow at the National Centre for Involvement at the University of Warwick, said the exercise 12 days ago in nine cities around Britain was designed to come up with a popular mandate to proceed with nuclear power. \"Partial information was rammed down the public's throat. It was totally impractical for people to make a rational decision based on the information they were fed. The way it was put together was designed so that a particular view would emerge,\" said Dr Dorfman, who has convened an academic group who will report next month on the process. The consultation suggested that 45% of the public is in favour of nuclear power, and 23% against - very different from most polls in the last 20 years. A professional marketeer on the consultation said yesterday: \"The whole setup was loaded towards nuclear. The government's position was put consistently but the opposition points were not. The overall impact of the questions was was very narrow.\" The person asked to remain anonymous but claims to have no link to any environment group, and was employed by Opinion Leader Research (OLR) to help run one of nine meetings. Yesterday several people invited to take part said they were angry about how questions were posed. \"We were provided with a limited amount of background, only very occasionally including alternative viewpoints of Greenpeace and other groups, and then the government's viewpoint was given,\" said Jackie Turpin who attended one meeting.

The government's roadmap to a low-carbon UK called for a 34% cut in emissions by 2020, with the power sector contributing the bulk of that saving. The Weston barrage, running 10 miles across the Severn estuary between Weston-super-Mare and Cardiff, is by far the largest of four tidal power schemes being considered by government and would be the centrepiece of the nation's renewable energy plan. It could generate 8.6 gigawatts of zero-carbon electricity from the Severn – the equivalent of eight large coal-fired power stations – and would be the single largest renewable energy project in Europe. But the £5bn flagship scheme would permanently flood nearly 35,000 hectares (86,000 acres) of internationally protected wetlands. It would also destroy some of Britain's most important fisheries in the Severn, Wye and Usk catchment areas, said Lord Smith in an interview with the Guardian. \"The great wall across the Severn channel poses the classic environmental dilemma. It would generate 5% of all the UK's electricity needs but at a huge cost in terms of fishing and habitats. These immense environmental impacts outweigh the carbon reduction benefits which you would get. We are advising the government on this pretty strongly,\" said the government's chief environmental adviser. \"There must be ways of harnessing tidal power from the estuary without the gross impacts that the Weston scheme would have. I regret that we are not putting as much effort as we could into tidal reefs and defences. We should be addressing the possibility of tidal power around the country. Tidal energy should be one of the key ways of generating electricity\", he said. Smith's comments will not be welcomed by the government which this week committed itself to generating 20% of the UK's energy from renewable sources within only 11 years, but it is meeting technical and planning delays with wind power. A decision on the barrage will be given next year but ministers are keen to see it started because it would contribute more to emission cuts than any other scheme. The energy minister, Lord Hunt, said this week: \"The Cardiff-Weston barrage has the potential to save the equivalent of the yearly CO2 emissions from all homes in Wales.\" The barrage, which would be a huge engineering feat on the scale of some of the world's biggest construction projects, is shaping up to be one the most contentious environmental issues of the decade. The National Trust, the RSPB and WWF, together representing more than 5 million people, have said that a barrage would be \"economically dubious\" and \"ecologically disastrous\". They have also argued that 5m tonnes of CO2 would be emitted during construction and another 5m tonnes during transport of the materials, undermining claims that the barrage would help reduce emissions. Smith also warned the nuclear industry, another part of the energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband's \"trinity\" of low-carbon electricity plans, that climate change could seriously affect their costs. He said the agency would demand that nuclear power companies build major sea defences to protect nuclear power against the sea level rises expected over the next 100 years. \"Virtually all the new [nuclear] stations are by the sea. We will look at them on a case-by-case basis but all sites must be fully defensible. The power companies know that they will have to defend them on a very large scale. Protection against flood risk must be absolute.\" Smith also questioned Miliband's intention to preserve low-cost mass air travel, revealed in the Guardian this week. Calling for a debate on the future of aviation, he argued that climate change made it doubtful people could fly so much in 40 years' time. \"By 2050 we should have reduced greenhouse gases by 80%, which means we will have 20% left. How much of that 20% should be taken by aviation? \"Aeroplanes will get more efficient but they will not be able to completely remove their carbon emissions. By 2050 we will need to have decided how much flying we can do. \""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/gallery/2007/apr/18/1","type":"gallery","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2007-04-18T10:31:21Z","webTitle":"Sellafield nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2007/apr/18/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/gallery/2007/apr/18/1","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield nuclear power station","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/06/co2-emissions-reduction-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-05T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Bright sparks: more ideas for reducing CO2 emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/06/co2-emissions-reduction-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/06/co2-emissions-reduction-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Bright sparks","bodyText":"Giant algae stomachs Mark Capron from California advocated farming kelp and algae in the ocean. This can be harvested and digested in giant plastic stomachs suspended in the seawater. The digestion results in methane, which can be used as a fuel, and captures CO2, which can be buried under the sea in plastic tanks, from the atmosphere. \"Farming kelp or algae on 4% of the world's oceans would be enough to remove all the CO2 we currently produce\", Capron claimed. Super-efficient cooking stoves A third of the world's population rely on the burning of biomass, such as wood and dung, for cooking and sterilising water. This drives deforestation, creates CO2 and produces soot, exacerbating global warming. Peter Scott discussed his super-efficient stoves, which can slash emissions and wood requirements for as little as $7 each.

For Conservatives it ranked fourth out of five sections, under Protect the Environment. Liberal Democrats put environment on the cover, then eschewed a separate section in favour of green proposals in every policy area, even defence. Vision Labour: \"Our vision is of a society where economic prosperity and quality of life come not from exploiting the natural world but from its defence.\" Conservatives: \"We have a vision of a greener Britain... This is a country which has become the world's first low carbon economy.\" Liberal Democrats: \"We must hand on to our children a planet worth living on. That requires action across government.\" Regulation Labour said \"only active government can shape markets to prioritise green growth and job creation\"; it cannot be left to individuals and businesses \"alone\". Conservatives appeared to say the opposite: \"Instead of using rules and regulations to impose a centralised worldview, we will go with the grain of human nature, creating new incentives and market signals which reward people for doing the right thing.\" Liberal Democrats promise a general rule of \"one in, one out\" for new regulations. In reality all three parties offer a mix of regulations and incentives. Targets No party disagrees with existing commitments to cut emissions 20% by 2020, and 80% by 2050. On the EU target for 15% renewable energy by 2020 - Conservatives repeat the target whereas the other two parties translate it into electricity needs: by then Labour promise 40% \"low carbon\" electricity, Lib Dems pledge 40% \"non carbon\" electricity.\" Given another term as the majority party, Labour says it would press for a higher cut of 30% by 2020 across the EU as part of a global deal. Tories are silent on this. Lib Dems suggest the EU should adopt the higher 30% target anyway. Lib Dems also pledge zero emissions from electricity by 2050. Climate &amp; energy Labour and Conservatives offer a mix of renewables, new nuclear and \"clean coal\" using carbon capture and storage - how clean is not specified - alongside more local energy generation, incentives for home efficiency, and \"smart grids\" to manage demand. Lib Dems rule out nuclear and say coal plants must capture high levels of emissions. There is agreement on a green investment bank, though critics called for all parties to pledge more funds to it, such as income from selling carbon trading allowances. Homes Labour are building 10,000 new homes in rural areas; Lib Dems want to restore 250,000 empty homes, and toughen new building regulations. To make homes more energy efficient, Lib Dems are offering a £400 cashback for improvements in their first year in power. All three major parties offer loan schemes to be paid back from energy savings on bills, and support the feed in tariff to pay home owners for renewable energy they export to the grid, something Lib Dems offer to increase. Transport Labour alone is adamant it will expand Heathrow airport; the others promise to reverse the decision. Lib Dems also pledge higher air taxes from planes instead of passengers, and a national road pricing scheme, offset by axing vehicle excise duty. All three parties offer high speed rail. Conservation Both Labour and Conservatives offer more protected areas, and in particular to create \"wildlife corridors\" along which species can move as they adapt to climate change. Lib Dems offer a new protection status for locally important areas, and to double woodland. Conservatives also propose \"conservation credits\" whereby any loss of biodiversity is compensated by improvements elsewhere. Genetically modified crops Conservatives will let GM crops go ahead when they are \"safe for people and the environment\". The manifestos of the other two main parties don't mention GM - indeed all three are woefully quiet on food policy - but a Labour spokesman told Farmers Weekly that the party also supports GM when it's judged safe, and the Lib Dems dodge the issue by asking for another debate. Waste Labour and Conservatives talk of \"Zero waste Britain\", Liberal Democrats want to set it as a target. Labour are most radical in proposing to ban most of what goes to landfill in future, Conservatives want councils to encourage people to recycle by paying them, Lib Dems are more vague about how they would succeed in their ambition for \"more recycling, and a huge increase in anaerobic digestion to generate energy\". None of the three publicly advocates incineration. Green taxation Environmental taxes fell as a proportion of tax in Labour's first decade, and the party makes no mention of the issue, nor of any specific green taxes. Conservatives say enviornmental taxes will rise, will be carefully designed to change behaviour, and will be offset by other tax cuts; talk of ending the climate change levy on commercial energy use has been replaced with a pledge to reform it; and the party has an overall commitment to \"lower and simpler taxation\". Liberal Democrats talk of specifics only, suggesting higher taxes on aviation to pay for income tax cuts and aid for developing countries responding to climate change; otherwise the party says tax rises would be \"a last resort\". Points of difference Labour: landfill bans; continued ban on fox hunting; a review of land use, to balance demands for more food, wildlife protection and development. Conservatives: a floor under the carbon price; annual energy statement to parliament; reform of energy regulator, Ofgem. Lib Dems: make all public buildings energy efficient, starting with schools; tax on financial transactions and aviation and shipping emissions to help poorer countries mitigate and adapt to climate change; better protect gardens by declaring them greenfield sites.

And when a metal tripod drill was spotted, it was presumed the farmer wanted to set up a water bore hole. But as a string of vans bearing the names of soil analysis companies and then a host of Portakabins turned up at the tiny hamlet of Kirksanton, questions began to be asked. When those living on the farm said they could not talk about it and overall-wearing site workers announced they had signed the Official Secrets Act, rumours ran riot. Even then few guessed the truth that was finally revealed in letters from RWE: that the German energy group was \"investigating the possibility\" of building a nuclear power station there. Tomorrow RWE will nominate the site as part of a wider move to kickstart a nuclear revolution aimed at giving Britain more energy security and lower carbon emissions. RWE will also suggest a site at Egremont further up the \"Energy Coast\" near Sellafield while EDF of France and E.ON of Germany will put forward their favoured sites for building a new generation of reactors. These companies will be scrambling to put in bids by the formal deadline tomorrow for land being auctioned off by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). RWE insists its priority is to hold discussions with local representatives and groups but already villagers have held protest meetings and threatened to abandon their homes rather than accept a reactor there. Leukaemia \"We live in a beautiful part of our world and that's all we've got here really,\" said Sue Abbott, whose smallholding sits alongside the site. \"We are going to have major building works, light pollution, all the roads - and that will change the area completely even without the aspect of nuclear danger.\" Michael Wills, a fireman whose wife's family have owned their home in the village for 54 years, said he was concerned about the future for his five children. \"With our young family, growing up next to a nuclear power station would be very worrying for us. I know links to cancers and leukaemia are not proven absolutely but there is lots of evidence that there are links to nuclear power.\" He said locals had been given less than a month to take part in the consultation. \"It's not giving us any time to put together a credible case based on the correct facts as to why this is the wrong place for a nuclear power station.\" The leader of the Millom Without parish council, Wilson Huck, said he was concerned about road links to the area, an issue that has already been raised at Sellafield. \"Access is very limited and, although the council hasn't met to discuss this yet, I think we feel access is even worse than at Sellafield.\" Some residents would welcome the plant, which - it is rumoured - could provide up to 600 jobs. Rosie Mathisen, energy opportunities director at West Lakes Renaissance, the urban regeneration company that has been working to attract interest in building nuclear reactors in west Cumbria, said: \"We welcome RWE's commitment to nuclear new-build. Their interest in these two sites is testament to the attractiveness of west Cumbria as a place for new-build, given the area's world-renowned skills base and strong support for the nuclear industry.\" Huck said he feared jobs would largely go to outside experts while existing businesses, which include an organic nursery and several bed and breakfasts, a caravan park and farms, could be blighted by the plant. \"This bizarre selection of sites for reactors in west Cumbria by RWE smacks more of sticking a pin in the map and, by a stroke of luck, coming up with something just outside the National Park boundary than any properly considered site selection process,\" said Martin Forwood, campaign coordinator at Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment. \"Neither site anywhere near meets the government's criteria of being at an existing nuclear site, being close to where electricity is wanted or having suitable National Grid connections. Deadline \"Should RWE's plans go ahead, west Cumbrians can kiss goodbye to any notion of a diversified, clean and safe future for the region. With the possibility of hosting the UK's nuclear waste dump and the prospect of more reactors at Sellafield or on adjoining land owned by the NDA, the region will become the Lake District Nuclear Park - sitting dangerously alongside the much hallowed Lake District National Park.\" If all goes to plan the government will hold a formal consultation on these sites this year and publish a final policy statement next spring. Energy groups will then spend three years planning and licensing locations so that building could start in 2013 and operations begin in 2018, though few independent analysts believe that deadline will be met. Nuclear power is promising to make a comeback in Britain as well as France, the US and China at a time when some believe low-carbon alternatives such as wind and solar are not going to achieve the scale expected of them. Reactors remain deeply controversial, with concerns over cost, the threat of terrorism and the fact that radioactive waste remains toxic for hundreds of years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/jul/13/energy-cbi-wind-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-13T16:36:35Z","webTitle":"It's time to stand up to the energy giants | John Sauven","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/13/energy-cbi-wind-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/13/energy-cbi-wind-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"It's time to stand up to the energy giants","bodyText":"Against the backdrop of the worldwide economic downturn, it is ironic that the area often said to have the least business certainty, the renewables sector, is one of the few success stories. Globally this industry is bucking the trends, creating millions of new green jobs, increasing countries' energy independence and reducing climate-changing emissions. So it is scandalous that the CBI should come out attacking the prime minister and the climate change secretary Ed Miliband's commitment to boosting this industry in Britain just days before the launch of a fresh government initiative. Not so much the \"voice of British business\" as the voice of French and German energy monopolies, for too long E.ON, RWE and EDF have dictated the terms of the British energy debate. Today's CBI report advocating that Britain scale back its renewable ambitions yet further is just the latest tactic by these utilities to shaft British business efforts in clean tech out of fear of new competition and the threat posed to their \"business as usual\" approach. EDF and E.ON admit they oppose ambition on renewables in case they undermine the economic case for the nuclear power stations they want to build. These arguments are now parroted verbatim by the CBI. It is no coincidence that Germany and Spain, which have shut the door on new nuclear power, have invested most in renewables and seen their green industries rocket. Spain now generates as much as 40% of its electricity from wind power and studies show the investment in renewables has lowered wholesale electricity prices in Spain by more than the cost of the incentive they used to kickstart the industry. Germany has created almost a quarter of a million new green jobs in renewables as a whole and £8.5bn a year for its economy from wind industry sales alone. While other countries got ahead of the UK in green tech, in a textbook case of the power of special interests operating in Whitehall, energy officials in Britain lobbied together with two German energy giants and the French state-owned atomic industry to systematically undermine and sabotage UK efforts on renewables. As the Guardian exposed almost two years ago, the former energy minister John Hutton initially attempted, in effect, to abolish Labour's commitment to increasing renewable generation altogether. Then one leak after another showed energy department officials seeking to wreck efforts on renewables by creating loopholes in the relevant European directive. As the BBC reported, over an 18-month period Hutton negotiated a reduction in the UK target, tried to get carbon-capture coal categorised as renewable energy, and argued that funding for renewable energy projects abroad should be able to count towards the UK targets. Meanwhile, anti-wind nimby groups with links to giant PR firms were set up to whip up anti-renewable hysteria with little transparency and much suspicion about who was really behind them, especially given that national government polling shows that 80% of people support wind power. Plans were even announced to knock down a wind farm to make way for a nuclear plant. Meanwhile, energy giants were busy buying up crucial grid connections for nuclear plants as the government failed to tackle massive backlogs in getting wind farms connected. No wonder earlier this year the wind manufacturer Vestas announced it would shut up shop in Britain, even as it expanded in other countries, such as the US and China, creating thousands of new jobs in those places and redundancies here. The UK renewables environment was so dire that it was driving green industry away. As the University of Exeter's professor of energy policy, Catherine Mitchell, put it, the UK's lack of innovation \"has been fought for, and won, by the large companies and lobbies, so they can carry on doing as they wish – despite the urgency of climate change\". Today's CBI report is more of the same. It is this that Miliband must challenge in his new strategy to be launched on Wednesday. The climate change secretary has successfully begun a radical transformation of his department and its attitude to renewable energy. His next test is whether he has the courage to stand up to the vested interests of foreign utilities and their CBI mouthpiece to stick to the promise he and the prime minister made to deliver on the UK's renewable energy and climate commitments in full."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2009/jul/28/mandelson-manufacturing-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-28T18:52:30Z","webTitle":"Labour put too much faith in City, admits Mandelson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/28/mandelson-manufacturing-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jul/28/mandelson-manufacturing-aid","fields":{"headline":"Labour put too much faith in City, admits Mandelson","bodyText":"Business secretary Lord Mandelson conceded that Labour put too much faith in the economic prowess of the City over the past decade, as he announced £150m-worth of government aid for manufacturing, with most going to the engineering firm Rolls Royce. Saying that taxpayers' support would secure or create 800 jobs in aerospace and nuclear power, and bring four new Rolls Royce factories to deprived areas of Britain, Mandelson said a healthy industrial sector was crucial to building a successful British economy. He said: \"We, like other governments, had taken for granted that our wealth would continue to be generated from the size of the financial sector, and that this would be replicated in the coming decade – but it won't.\" With more than a million manufacturing jobs lost since 1997, industry groups long complained that the government neglected them, in favour of the hefty tax revenues and high international profile from the success of the City. Sir John Rose, Rolls Royce chief executive, who appeared with Mandelson as he announced the government's investment, said it marked a welcome change of approach. \"It's extremely encouraging that there's now a recognition from the opposition and from the government that we need a much more balanced economy,\" he said. \"I hope that this will reverse several decades of aversion to industrial policy.\" Asked whether opportunities had been missed over the past 12 years to support British industry, he said, \"the shape of the economy that people say they want will affect the decisions that people make when they're at school or university. If people go on about the 'post industrial age,' then people will make decisions based on that.\" Mandelson has helped secure a marked shift in policy since he returned to government last year, moving the emphasis towards a more activist industrial strategy, instead of the laissez-faire approach of the past decade. \"What we have in a department like this is every pool of spending and every policy lever now joined under one roof, to make coherent sense of what government does in pursuing its strategy.\" The announcement included £45m to secure four new Rolls Royce factories in the UK, plus £45m from the government's Strategic Investment Fund earmarked for low carbon technologies, which Rolls will use to develop greener aeroplane engines. Rolls Royce is also leading a research programme called SAMULET – \"Strategic Affordable Manufacturing in the UK with Leading Environmental Technology,\" which received another £40m, much of it from the government's Technology Strategy Board. This will be used to support research centres in Sheffield, Glasgow and Ansty, near Coventry. Rose said the injection of cash would help to fulfil his £55bn order book, much of which involves projects to be delivered beyond 2011. Adam Marshall, Director of Policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) welcomed the news. \"The future of the UK economy must be built on more solid foundations, and advanced manufacturing should be at its heart,\" he said. \"The government's investment is a welcome boost for new technologies, particularly in aerospace, where the UK has a competitive advantage.\" Several other, smaller investments were also announced as part of the £150m state aid package, including £4m to expand the Manufacturing Advisory Service so that it can help small firms to go green, and £500,000 in a Centre of Excellence for Silicon Design in the South West. However, with the emphasis firmly on aerospace and nuclear power, green groups complained that the government was backing \"white elephants,\" instead of nurturing new industries. Andrew Simms, director of the New Economics Foundation argued that because aviation is capital intensive, the government would get more bang for its buck by supporting green technologies. \"Rather than new jobs in new industries, this is a small number of jobs in white elephant industries,\" he said. Sarah North, campaigns director at Greenpeace, said, \"Mandelson's vision for Britain's clean industrial future is proving neither British nor clean.\" The government, she said, was supporting, \"the fastest-growing source of carbon emissions – aviation.\" However, Mandelson insisted that his department was, \"backing winners,\" instead of \"picking winners,\" the much derided industrial strategy of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Tony Hayward, chief executive of the UK's largest oil company, said that British government ministers risked being seduced by \"headline-grabbing options\" such as offshore wind and clean coal in a bid to bolster energy security and meet climate-change goals. BP makes billions of pounds a year from oil and gas, but is also investing in onshore wind farms in America. Talking to the Guardian exclusively, the BP boss said he was not calling for the third round of wind licensing in the deep waters of the North Sea to be shelved. But he did believe that the heavily subsidised move into wind power should be slowed down, because it would not deliver anything like the targets set for it: possibly 15 gigawatts of power rather than the 25GW the wind industry expects. And in a speech due to be delivered to the London Business school today, he says: \"Energy efficiency, gas-fired power, lighter cars and biofuels all offer relatively low-cost routes, while other headline-grabbing options are not the most cost-effective. \"With today's technology, carbon capture to make clean coal, for example, is very expensive. Offshore wind is also costly – for example in comparison to onshore wind, which is now a big business for BP in the United States – and indeed to nuclear.\" Hayward told the Guardian that wind power, like nuclear energy, was nowhere near being commercially viable and would rely for some time on \"sovereign\" intervention by governments. Instead, he said, there should be more emphasis put on gas, which was very commercial, using a mixture of what remained of UK North Sea supplies and imports. The BP man believed the UK should drop its \"paranoid\" concerns about gas imports from Russia and accept that piped and liquefied natural gas from overseas sources offered a better solution to help beat global warming and energy insecurity in the short term. \"There is a lot of gas in the world. There are a lot of diverse sources of gas in the world. The paranoia has been about Russia, but it is misplaced. We have approximately zero Russian gas in the UK [imported currently] and if you look at Europe, the imports of Russian gas into Europe have halved since 1980.\" Hayward, whose Russian TNK-BP joint venture is a major part of the wider oil company's business, said the fear of Russia using energy as a political weapon was \"massively exaggerated\". He believed Britain should not be concerned even if Siberian gas accounted for 10% of Britain's imports, as long as 90% came from a diverse group of suppliers such as Norway, Qatar and Algeria, as they already did. The BP chief executive was speaking on the day the UK energy regulator said the power sector needed a massive shake-up. Ofgem expressed concerns about an undue reliance on gas imports and raised the possibility of higher subsidies for wind and other renewables. But Hayward, in remarks that will be seen by supporters of clean technology as partly self-serving, argued it would be a mistake to rush into a big change in energy priorities of this kind. He believes that the UK needs to build up a new supply chain and skills to serve pioneering offshore wind projects in deep waters and the building of new nuclear power stations after a break of 15 years. \"Certainly with offshore wind and nuclear, you learn a lot as you go along. That's very important, and I have question marks about whether that would be true with the [ambitious] objectives that have been set for wind. \"I am a great supporter of nuclear. The country will need to rebuild the skills. It will take 20 years, so they are all the right things for the long term. \"Shaping the energy policy is [about] what takes precedence over what ... we need to make certain through gas that we can keep the lights on over the next 10 years.\" The BP chief executive did agree with Ofgem's Alistair Buchanan that the UK had reached a critical point in its energy history and needed to change the market model with increased government involvement. \"It has been true throughout history that at certain points in time government has had to intervene to shift the boundaries of the market to allow the right market structure to evolve,\" said Hayward. He added: \"We did not displace coal with gas in the 1960s and 1970s without a massive government intervention ... we are probably at one of those points again.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/may/11/top-50-twitter-climate-accounts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-11T12:35:30Z","webTitle":"Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/may/11/top-50-twitter-climate-accounts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/may/11/top-50-twitter-climate-accounts","fields":{"headline":"Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow","bodyText":"From ministers' tweets inside climate talks and cameraphone photos of climate activism as it happens, to tips on how to live a greener life and 140-character global warming news updates: who are the key people and organisations you should be following on Twitter if you're interested in climate change?

Friends of the Earth (FoE) and other environmental groups have warned of the potential for civil disobedience. So far, England is largely unaware of a new planning regime which kicks in later this year. Arguably, it's the most radical policy shift since the ground-breaking 1947 Town and Country Planning Act and associated legislationbrought a sense of order to the country, creating national parks, rights of way, green belts and much else. But according to FoE, the new regime will force moderate environmental opinion to choose between legal challenges and direct action. \"And the act will generate both on an unprecedented scale,\" FoE's planning adviser, Hugh Ellis, has warned. The local government minister, John Healey, who steered the 2008 Planning Act through the Commons, insists the new system will be clearer and less complex, \"more open and, we would argue, fairer because it builds in a requirement for the promoters of a project to consult widely even before they submit an application\". More light will be shed on these projects later this year when Whitehall departments publish major policy statements under the all-embracing infrastructure label, ranging from new runways to nuclear power stations, wind farms, major road schemes and much else. Alongside this process is a parallel, more contentious exercise, involving the creation of a powerful quango called the Infrastructure Planning Commission, or IPC. It will begin functioning later this year. The idea is that the IPC, rather than ministers, will become the final arbiter of how these policy statements are put into practice: where to site a nuclear power station, a wind farm, or a new runway. Sir Michael Pitt, former chief executive of Kent county council, who recently headed a government inquiry into the handling of the 2007 floods in England, has just been named as the government's preferred candidate to chair the IPC, which will be based in Bristol. Opposition to the reforms is at two levels. On one level, groups such as FoE say the IPC will ride roughshod over local democracy – a charge stoutly denied by Healey – because the quango, rather than ministers, will in theory have the final say over the siting of controversial projects. Certainly, the potential for high court challenges, through judicial reviews, is high. Recently, the shadow cabinet has jumped on the bandwagon. Underlining the Tories' commitment to localism, David Cameron said a future Conservative government would scrap the IPC, while retaining national policy statements. At the heart of the reforms lies the Treasury. When he was chancellor, Gordon Brown took on board business concerns about the lengthy inquiry into Heathrow's Terminal 5. Brown wanted a fast-track planning system for major projects to eliminate the need for such long hearings and push forward schemes deemed crucial to the national interest. Aside from the Terminal 5 saga, Healey's department – Communities and Local Government – quotes more mundane, but nonetheless vital projects, notably a six-year planning delay in upgrading high-voltage power lines in North Yorkshire as a result of a public inquiry. Other critics, while generally supportive of the spirit behind the legislation, argue that policy statements themselves will be too narrowly focused. In all, 12 policy statements are planned – five covering energy alone (electricity networks, nuclear power, fossil fuels, renewable energy, and oil and gas networks). Four are likely to be published this summer, with nuclear power next spring. Sir Peter Hall, president of the Town and Country Planning Association, thinks it is ludicrous that one single energy strategy is not being published. Similarly on the transport front, four policy statements are being planned rather than one over-arching strategy. The most contentious, on airports, will merely be a re-hash of an earlier aviation white paper. Whether it takes into account the sharp reduction in air travel over the past year, with clear implications for a third runway at Heathrow, is open to question. • Peter Hetherington writes on communities and regeneration for Society Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/oct/28/centrica-windfarm-subsidy-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-28T16:51:01Z","webTitle":"Centrica issues green energy warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/28/centrica-windfarm-subsidy-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/oct/28/centrica-windfarm-subsidy-warning","fields":{"headline":"Centrica issues green energy warning","bodyText":"Centrica gave the go-ahead to one of the UK's largest offshore windfarms today but warned the government that its 2020 renewable energy targets would be missed unless the current level of subsidy was maintained. The firm, which owns British Gas, announced that it would invest £725m in the 270MW project off the coast of Lincolnshire, which will be able to power a city twice the size of Cambridge when the wind blows. The government announced in the last budget that offshore windfarms approved by March next year would receive higher subsidies, or renewables obligation certificates (Rocs). But officials said tonight that there were no plans to make this arrangement permanent, leaving the economics of offshore wind unviable, according to Centrica. Sarwjit Sambhi, managing director of Centrica's power business, said: \"Without [the higher subsidy] we could not have gone ahead with the Lincs project.\" The project, which will boost the size of Centrica's wind portfolio by two thirds, secured planning permission months ago but the slump in energy prices has resulted in a host of wind and other power projects being scrapped. The windfarm, 8km off the coast near Skegness, will have 75 turbines. Construction would begin next year and electricity would begin to be generated around 2012, the company said. Centrica also announced that it had sold a 50% stake in three of its smaller offshore windfarms to a subsidiary of Société Générale's asset management arm for £84m. The company added it had raised a further £340m of debt, secured against the three windfarms, from a consortium of banks. The proceeds from both will go towards funding the Lincolnshire project. Ofgem, the energy regulator, has predicted that £200bn will need to be invested in the next decade in green energy equipment to meet the 2020 renewable targets. These targets would require the UK to generate a third of its electricity from renewable sources such as windfarms. Centrica has promised to invest £15bn by 2020 but Sambhi said that other investors, beyond energy companies, would also be needed. \"[£200bn] is a big chunk of investment to make. We need to attract other investor classes.\" The government is setting up an independent body designed to handle planning applications for large projects such as windfarms or nuclear power plants. By taking such decisions away from ministers, the hope is that national concerns would take precedence over local objections and fewer schemes would get blocked. Sambhi said that the 2020 targets could be met, but only if the current level of subsidies was maintained. \"The new planning regulations would need to be as smooth as the government has promised,\" he added. The Conservatives have promised to hand back the final say-so to ministers. Sambhi said that their decisions would have to be \"transparent\" for the system to work. Sam Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive, said: \"Our decision to build Lincs illustrates our continued commitment to develop renewable generation and confirms our position as one of the UK leaders in green energy. The government's enhanced financial framework for offshore wind has been fundamental in improving the overall project economics of this development.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/feb/28/letters-carbon-capture-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-28T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: Carbon capture test is ready to go","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/28/letters-carbon-capture-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/feb/28/letters-carbon-capture-technology","fields":{"headline":"Carbon capture test is ready to go","bodyText":"Centrica chief Sam Laidlaw claims that carbon capture and storage technology will not help Britain secure big cuts in emissions before 2030 (Financial, 27 February). Perhaps he is ignorant of the pace of EU developments. Within the past three months, framework legislation for CO2 storage has been enacted, a fi nancial mechanism worth up to €6bn has been made available to support construction of major demonstration projects, and allocation of a further €1bn is expected shortly. Power plant manufacturers such as Alstom have publicly declared that CCS equipment will be commercially available by 2015. The coal-fi red power station proposed by E.ON at Kingsnorth in Kent will emit as much CO2 as is currently saved by every single wind farm in the country. I accept that coal has a role to play in meeting our electricity needs, but no new coal plants must be approved unless equipped with CCS technology. The savings in emissions will rapidly become very big indeed. Chris Davies MEP Lib Dem, North West England • I was mentioned in the Diary on 24 and 25 February, which implied that my pro-nuclear stance is because I have worked for part of the RWE group, which is pro-nuclear. Also that I and Chris Smith are now in favour of nuclear power because of our links with the Labour party. This is predictable criticism, but not true. I agree that everyone should be clear about any financial or party political interests. I was clear in my interview with the Independent, though they didn't include this. So I emailed the Guardian and other papers on 23 February, the day the Independent article appeared. The message ended: \"I should say that I am now doing some consultancy work for npower renewables, whose parent company, RWE, is a nuclear utility – among many other forms of generation – and is now seeking to build new nuclear power stations in the UK. My consultancy work is on renewables, and I am doing it to try to help RWE Innogy – of which npower renewables is now the UK arm – achieve its ambitious targets of 4.5Gw of renewable capacity by 2012, and 10Gw by 2020. \"No one from the RWE group has asked me to say anything about nuclear. I would not have taken work from the RWE group if I had not already decided that nuclear power should be supported. Nor am I saying this because I've worked in the past for the Labour party. I now believe that Labour is right to support new nuclear power stations. But it was wrong to support the invasion of Iraq. It is wrong to want to upgrade Trident. And it is wrong to support airport expansion.\" I'm not any longer a member of the Labour party, and am a floating voter.

Barack Obama put his reputation on the line at Copenhagen by saying America would act on climate change. Now it's up to Congress. The House of Representatives passed the Waxman-Markey bill last June which would set a price on carbon, and would put progressively tighter limits on greenhouse gas emissions with a 17% cut from 2005 levels by 2020, and 80% by 2050. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, passed a nearly identical version of the bill out of the Senate environment committee last November. But action in the Senate has stalled. Boxer stared down a Republican boycott to get a bill through her committee. But Democrats are deeply reluctant to throw themselves into another full-on confrontation with Republicans so soon after the bruising battle over healthcare reform. What happens next? US environmental organisations say there is still a good chance the Senate will move ahead on a climate change bill this year. A triumvirate of Senators — Democrat John Kerry, Republican Lindsey Graham, and Independent Joe Lieberman — are working to craft a climate change bill they think would have a good chance of getting support from Republican as well as Democratic Senators. Kerry had earlier promised a blueprint late last year. The newest deadline is at the end of this month. The Senate is then expected to begin its push in the spring. Did the Copenhagen climate summit hurt or help prospects for the bill? Obama's 13 hours on the ground diplomacy at Copenhagen was seen as evidence of his commitment to action — which should help give momentum to the bill. The deal reached at Copenhagen by the biggest emitters — though it fell far short of hopes for the summit — also includes important concessions from China to begin curbing its rate of emissions, and to open its books on how it cuts emissions. That will help neutralise the argument that China is not doing its bit, and that America would give up competitive advantage if it took on energy reform. Will the Senate bill look just like Waxman-Markey? Not entirely. Kerry and Graham are determined to get Republican support, which means there will mean a number of hard compromises for environmentalists. One is an expansion of nuclear power, with Republicans pushing hard for more cheap government loans for new plants, plus streamlined regulations. There is also a push for offshore oil drilling. Other ideas include limiting the kinds of industries that would be compelled to begin reducing their emissions. One proposal under discussion would only put an emissions cap on power plants. What about the US midterm elections? The Democrats anticipate losses in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2010 elections which will further impair the prospects of getting climate change law. But even the approach of the 2010 elections are making an impact. Democratic leaders say the Senate must pass climate change bill by spring 2010, if there is to be any US legislation at all. Democrats from coal and old industry states will be cautious about signing up to sweeping energy and climate laws in the run-up to midterm elections in November 2010. The oil, coal and manufacturing lobbies have been spending millions to frame the proposed laws as measures that will fuel unemployment and increase home heating bills. What if the Senate fails to act? Climate change legislation may stall in the Senate, but the federal government, and several states and cities are moving ahead. The business world is also coming on side. The Obama administration has raised fuel efficiency standards for cars. California, the biggest state, has ordered power companies to get one-third of its electricity from clean and renewable energy by 2020. Perhaps most importantly, the Environmental Protection Agency said last month that it would begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions. However, some Republicans want to keep the EPA out of that role. The Senate is due to vote on January 20 on whether to delay EPA regulatory action. How does this affect a global deal to curb carbon emissions? One of the key outcomes from Copenhagen is a commitment from industrialised countries to raise $100bn a year from 2020 to help the most vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. But America's promise to mobilise its share of the $100bn depends on the establishment of a carbon market — which will be created through climate change legislation. Obama administration officials have said America will raise its share from a variety of sources — not just government funds. No climate change law means no US carbon market and sharply reduced funds for poor countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/jul/16/ecotown-turbine-commercial-political","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-16T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ecotowns and turbines are a political slap in the face of the landscape | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/jul/16/ecotown-turbine-commercial-political","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/jul/16/ecotown-turbine-commercial-political","fields":{"headline":"Ecotowns and turbines are a political slap in the face of the landscape","bodyText":"The British government is to permit the desecration of upland and coastal Britain in the hope that this will shift the climatic balance of Planet Earth. All past plans and protections are being torn up. Markets are being distorted. Local democracy is to be abandoned. Extraordinary sums of money are given to private firms and individuals. The issue is not national security or prosperity but a hope somehow to prevent a long-term rise in the level of the sea. Where huge sums of public money are at stake, reason is shoved aside and arguments degenerate into crude politics. Climate change is like defence during the cold war, enveloped in hysteria of fear, envy, class, greed, commercial interest and intellectual chicanery. As big anti-carbon replaces big carbon in the lobbying stakes, statistics become gibberish, millions become billions and megawatts become gigawatts submerged in tonnes of CO2. Yesterday the government announced four so-called ecotowns, as if communities were created at the stroke a ministerial pen. New ecotown is close to a contradiction in terms. The emphasis is not on conservation but on anything involving ground-breaking, construction and fees. Like Yvette Cooper's urban Pathfinder clearances, ecotowns ignore the social dysfunctionality of new towns and are carbon extravagant, built from scratch with new infrastructure for car-dependent commuters. These arguments are not about global warming but about politics. Demand the conservation of existing communities and landscape and you will be told that new settlements are \"about consumer choice\", as the Co-op, hopeful developer of a Leicestershire ecotown, said yesterday. Even some greens have disowned ecotowns as nothing but executive housing estates refashioned. The wind debate is no less dominated by a mix of politics and commerce. Turbine parks require excavating carbon sinks, concreting them and making and installing turbines and pylons, usually to distribute small, even trivial, amounts of intermittent electricity. Yet the argument is now symbolic. Sacrificing the Lake District, the Golden Valley, the Scottish islands, even the Wiltshire vales is like Aztecs killing virgins, evidence of the machismo of power in a godly cause. This is enhanced by a rerun of town/country antagonism, with metropolitan journalists shouting nimby at their country cousins (there being no danger of a power station on Hyde Park or Clapham Common). Both left and right are now roaming the land looking for places to anchor their guns. On the left, wind, trains, ships and ecotowns are good while cars, planes, trucks and coal are bad. On the right the vote goes to nuclear, solar and conservation. Turbines are in one month and out the next, barrages out then in. If the word sustainable can be slapped before any noun, it is sanctified. An opponent is never wrong – since in this debate facts are garbage – but hypocritical or a nimby. I know of no better symbol of this idiocy than the single giant turbine now towering over the Mendips. Its meagre output is not even worth a pylon, yet it is a totemic slap in the face of the landscape by a farmer in league with the exchequer. It would never be allowed in the Chilterns or Cotswolds – but this is about politics, not energy conservation. Likewise the ban-the-bombers have found a new cause in opposing nuclear power. Some would do so even if it were blessed by the Archangel Gabriel or, as in this case, by the green guru, James Lovelock. Meanwhile not a kilowatt is derived from the massive energy surging back and forth across estuarial Britain, because the start-up costs are high and there is no lobby for the rental subsidies that have made British onshore wind the most expensive energy source on earth. Water cascades unharnessed down mountains. Buildings leak energy. Vehicles sit burning fuel at badly phased traffic lights. Nobody cares because such energy conservation does not sit on an annual report like a photograph of a turbine. Navigating a course through the climate change debate is near impossible because of this noise. Ministers rushed to wind because it offered a photogenic quick fix. Its exorbitant cost-per-unit could be partly disguised in energy bills and its opponents could be dismissed as rural hicks. At the same time, in 2004, Blair was deriding nuclear power stations to parliament by joking that if a questioner kept talking about nuclear he would \"put a power station in your constituency\". My own belief is that the quest for reduced carbon emissions must lie in conserving every drop of energy on land – especially that \"buried\" in existing buildings and open space – and capturing every drop of energy in the sunny sky and surging sea. But there are no magic bullets. Some balance of cost and benefit must be assessed other than by those with a commercial or political interest. To every climate change argument there is an answer. Despoiling the landscape may generate some fraction of what is claimed but people will burn more fuel travelling farther in search of wildness. New towns may be fuel efficient, but require increased car use. Turbines, barrages and nuclear stations have their part to play, but there is no point in denying they are visually intrusive. That is why they must be tested against the concept of outstanding natural beauty which the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, now decries. The current anger at the march of turbines and pylons across the hills of Britain is not from nimbys. Government money has lubricated most backyard owners to support wind power. It comes from those who appreciate the beauty of the countryside and who question the industrial spoliation of miles of open landscape for a pitiful net gain to climate change. They are people who object to ministers lying about \"20%\" of Britain's energy ever coming from wind. Nuclear power stations, barrages and solar panels are at least less intrusive and more productive. Such a balance goes by the board under an avalanche of subsidy. I am told of a recent meeting in Whitehall at which a junior minister and a minor civil servant were up against some two dozen people from the renewables lobby – mostly in energy and construction – all demanding public money and planning easements with varying degrees of political menace. It was no contest. Fifty years of democratic town and country planning were swept aside. Lobbyists playing the global salvation card are like policemen playing national security as a way to dodge the democratic process. It is the default mode of modern politics and is brainless accountability. Miliband may not care for the British uplands – despite their being the largest carbon sink in the land – but I sense that most Britons do. To secure a short-term sacrifice for a long-term gain requires people to be persuaded, not just terrorised into submission. This applies to wind power as well as to nuclear, to planning as well as to conservation, to taxation as well as to subsidy. For the moment, amid the clamour and the greed, I hear no still small voice of reason. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2009/nov/29/iran-10-new-nuclear-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-29T20:32:51Z","webTitle":"Iran defies United Nations with plans for 10 new nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/iran-10-new-nuclear-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/nov/29/iran-10-new-nuclear-plants","fields":{"headline":"Iran defies United Nations with plans for 10 new nuclear plants","bodyText":"Iran today sent a defiant signal to the international community by announcing plans to build 10 uranium enrichment plants days after it was condemned by the UN for concealing activities that are feared may be designed to produce an atomic bomb. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government said the plants would be the same size as the main enrichment complex at Natanz, central Iran, and work would begin within two months. \"We have a friendly approach towards the world but at the same time we won't let anyone harm even one iota of the Iranian nation's rights,\" the president said. The aim was to produce 250-300 tonnes of nuclear fuel a year by using centrifuges with a higher speed. The announcement seems likely to strengthen the hands of those arguing for sanctions if negotiations do not resume soon. The Foreign Office called the development \"a matter of serious concern\". The news from Tehran followed Friday's rare display of unanimity by the security council's \"big five\" – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – who condemned Iran for concealing an enrichment plant in a mountainside near Qom. The 25-3 vote by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, was seen as a sign of deepening exasperation over the impasse. Mohammed ElBaradei, the outgoing IAEA chief, warned that talks were at \"a dead end\". As a signatory to the nuclear non- proliferation treaty, Iran has the right to generate nuclear power for peaceful purposes, which is what is says it wants to do. But five UN resolutions demand it suspend enrichment and it is refusing to comply. Nor is Iran any closer to allaying suspicions it is seeking to secretly build a nuclear weapon. It has been asked by the IAEA to discuss evidence of warhead-related research activities but has refused. Having been caught cheating in the past, its repeated denials have little credibility. In recent weeks, after talks in Geneva and Vienna with the big five and Germany, Iran has seemed to reject a proposal under which most of its uranium would be shipped to France and Russia for processing into fuel for use in civilian reactors. An arrangement of that kind would give Iran the nuclear fuel it needs but provide guarantees that it was not being diverted for military purposes. Analysts and officials suggested the Iranian move was more about making gestures than a realistic plan. \"This is mostly about presenting two fingers to the world,\" said one diplomat. Others also pointed to the president's domestic problems, where he is under pressure from conservatives in parliament, from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and from opposition supporters protesting against the \"theft\" of last June's election. \"It's bluster,\" said Sir Richard Dalton, a former British ambassador to Tehran. \"Iran can't afford 10 plants the size of Natanz and 500,000 centrifuges.\" But the move is likely to galvanise efforts to put together a package of sanctions, perhaps persuading Russia and China to back moves supported by the US, Britain and France. Israel welcomed Friday's censure by the IAEA but has made clear for months that it reserves the right to take pre-emptive military action if it felt that its own nuclear deterrence were to be challenged by Tehran. The US warned on Friday that its patience is not unlimited, but doors are being left open in the hope that Iran will somehow re-engage. Earlier today MPs announced the allocation of $20m for unnamed \"progressive\" groups to combat what it called US and British \"conspiracies.\" Iran's parliament said the money would be disbursed by a committee including representatives of the ministries of intelligence, foreign affairs and the Revolutionary Guards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/may/12/farmers-restricted-chernobyl-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-12T11:30:00Z","webTitle":"Britain's farmers still restricted by Chernobyl nuclear fallout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/12/farmers-restricted-chernobyl-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/may/12/farmers-restricted-chernobyl-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Britain's farmers still restricted by Chernobyl nuclear fallout","bodyText":"Nearly 370 farms in Britain are still restricted in the way they use land and rear sheep because of radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear power station accident 23 years ago, the government has admitted. Environmentalists have seized on the figures as proof of the enormous dangers posed by nuclear power as the UK moves towards building a new generation of plants around the country. Dawn Primarolo, minister for health, revealed 369 farms and 190,000 sheep were affected, but pointed out this was a tiny number compared with the immediate impact of radioactive fallout from Ukraine. \"This represents a reduction of over 95% since 1986, when approximately 9,700 farms and 4,225,000 sheep were under restriction across the United Kingdom. All restrictions in Northern Ireland were lifted in 2000,\" she added. Critics of the nuclear industry expressed alarm at the latest numbers, which they believed would increase public unease about the highly toxic and long-term impact of radioactivity. David Lowry, a member of Nuclear Waste Advisory Associates, said the figures demonstrated the \"unforgiving hazards\" of radioactivity dispersed into the environment, whether from Chernobyl in Ukraine, thousands of miles away and 23 years ago, or over decades from the Faslane nuclear submarine base in Scotland, as revealed by the Guardian last month. \"Ministers like to describe nuclear power as 'clean and green', as they press for up to 11 new reactors to be built across England and Wales. But these latest figures on Chernobyl fallout gives the lie to these claims. \"Any breach of containment accident at Sellafield's high activity liquid radioactive waste storage tanks would release many times the radioactivity released in the Chernobyl accident. And these tanks had an under-reported loss of coolant a month ago, so we have been warned,\" he added. Paul Dorfman, a former government adviser and a senior research fellow at the University of Warwick, was also concerned. \"Despite all the reassurances from government about nuclear safety ahead of a new civil nuclear programme in Britain, the latest revelations about the continuing Chernobyl legacy show the dangerous reality of atomic power,\" he said. The Ukraine explosion and fire was the biggest nuclear accident ever. In its aftermath 237 people suffered from acute radiation sickness, of whom 31 died within the first three months. Accurate statistics on the wider health problems have been hard to ascertain because the Soviet authorities of the time refused to provide details. More than 130,000 people were resettled from the immediate area and experts say there should be no farming there for at least 200 years. The Food Standards Agency said the release of radiocaesium-137 in upland areas of Britain is still able to pass easily from soil to grass and accumulate in sheep. The European Commission imposed a maximum limit of 1,000 becquerels per kilogram (bq/k) of radiocaesium in sheep meat affected by the accident to protect consumers. Under a \"mark and release\" scheme in the restricted areas, a farmer wishing to move animals out of the area must have them monitored by a hand-held device. \"Any sheep that exceed the working action level are marked with dye and are not released from restrictions,\" said a spokesman, who added that mass summer surveys of sheep are performed at farms where there is confidence that restrictions are no longer needed. Huw Alun Evans's farm, Hengwrt Uchaf in north Wales, is one of the 369 inside one restricted area. Thousands of his sheep have been scanned for more than two decades. Evans's animals have failed radiation tests if they have been on higher ground, but the danger levels drop after they have been brought down to graze on lower pastures. He says: \"I remember a meeting with civil servants at the time [1986] and got the impression they thought it would be short-lived. No-one had any idea it would go on this long.\" Revelations about the continuing impact of the Chernobyl accident come weeks after three different sites were bought in auction by EDF and other power companies for building new atomic plants in Britain. The sites at Bradwell in Essex, Wylfa in Anglesey and Hinkley Point in Somerset were auctioned for £400m by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. A similar process is expected to start shortly for land near the huge Sellafield nuclear complex in Cumbria, as the government moves to put in place new electricity generating plants to provide relatively low-carbon power and bolster domestic energy sources at a time when old atomic stations are nearing the end of their lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2008/jun/25/planning.gordonbrown","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-24T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Brown tries to head off revolt on planning changes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/25/planning.gordonbrown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2008/jun/25/planning.gordonbrown","fields":{"headline":"Brown tries to head off revolt on planning changes","bodyText":"Gordon Brown has intervened to offer fresh concessions to head off tonight's expected rebellion by up to 60 Labour MPs over controversial plans to hand over planning decisions for big projects, such as nuclear power stations and runways, to a new, unelected body. His offer to support one detailed rebel amendment, late on Monday night, led to a leading opponent, Clive Betts, Labour MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, deciding to back the government tonight. But other rebels, including John Grogan, MP for Selby, and John McDonnell, MP for Hayes and Harlington, are unconvinced. This means the government could face a close shave in the vote tonight. The revolt is concerned with the decision-making for big projects being handed over to the unelected body - the Infrastructure Planning Commission - subject to parliamentary scrutiny. MPs fear communities will lose their right to object to big schemes. The prime minister is thought to have been involved in the drafting of changes to the bill, to persuade some rebels to change their mind. Hazel Blears, the communities secretary, and John Healey, local government minister, met rebels last night. The government is to accept two amendments from Betts, requiring the new body by law to take account of communities' views and to hold public hearings if there are compulsory purchases. But Hugh Ellis, of Friends of the Earth, said: \"Frankly, this is turning Britain back ... to before the 1832 Reform Act when those with land had more rights than those who did not own anything.\" David Smith, chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, which represents the big power firms, was also critical, saying another tier of bureaucracy would be added without genuine public consultation. The Local Government Association expressed concern, predicting that as many as 40-50 schemes a year would go through the new commission."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/aug/04/centricabusiness.utilities","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-04T14:15:18Z","webTitle":"Centrica mulls British Energy merger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/04/centricabusiness.utilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/aug/04/centricabusiness.utilities","fields":{"headline":"Centrica mulls British Energy merger","bodyText":"Centrica confirmed today that it could try to merge with British Energy if French energy giant EDF does not launch a fresh bid for the UK's nuclear power generator. In a statement released at lunchtime, the owner of British Gas said that it was considering several options regarding British Energy, which runs eight nuclear power stations in the UK. This includes partnering on the construction of new nuclear power plants, or even a full-blown merger, it said. Centrica had been expected to take a 25% stake in British Energy if EDF's bid had gone through. It confirmed today that it was \"in discussions with a third party with a view to taking a minority ownership position in British Energy\", adding that it would only consider a merger if this third party - presumably EDF - dropped its plans. Centrica admitted, though, that it has not opened formal discussions with British Energy. British Energy's future has been in doubt since EDF abandoned a £12bn takeover bid last Friday. This threw the government's plans for a new generation of nuclear power plants into confusion, as British Energy's sites are seen as the most likely places to site new reactors. The government, which owns 35% of British Energy, is reportedly putting pressure on EDF to return to the negotiating table, but the company is thought to be reluctant to bid again only to run into a further rebuff. Its earlier bid collapsed because two shareholders, Invesco and M&amp;G, felt that EDF's 765p-a-share price was too low. It has been suggested that an offer of over £8 a share might be needed to for success. Both Invesco and M&amp;G are also shareholders in Centrica. As reported by the Guardian today, industry sources expect the issue to be discussed when chief executive Sam Laidlaw meets with the two investors. Centrica does not have the financial firepower to launch a cash bid, so a merger would have to involve shares – which could be less attractive to shareholders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2009/sep/07/guardian-environmen-website-relaunches","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-07T15:50:56Z","webTitle":"Guardian environment website relaunches with Miliband interview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/07/guardian-environmen-website-relaunches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2009/sep/07/guardian-environmen-website-relaunches","fields":{"headline":"Guardian environment site relaunches with Miliband interview","bodyText":"Guardian News &amp; Media is relaunching its environment website, featuring a live online question and answer session tomorrow with the foreign secretary, David Miliband.

In an interview with GQ magazine to be published later this week, the prime minister claimed he had known \"for some time\" that the Sun was planning to switch allegiances but said he still respected the paper's proprietor, Rupert Murdoch. The News International paper's decision to endorse David Cameron hours after Brown's speech to the Labour party conference in late September overshadowed the prime minister's address and was a hugely symbolic moment. The Sun had backed Labour for more than a decade. \"I have a lot of admiration for Rupert Murdoch personally,\" Brown told GQ's interviewer, Piers Morgan. \"His family come from not far from mine in Scotland, and his attitudes to hard work and getting on with things you can only admire. But the Sun has tried to become a political party. \"It's not personal about Rupert, he's always been very friendly to me. I think the Sun's made a mistake but that's up to them.\" Asked by Morgan which executive at News International made the decision to back the Tories, Brown said: \"I don't know, but it doesn't matter because the people will decide what happens at the next election, not the Sun. \"I think the Sun tried to become a political party that day and that was a terrible mistake. And I suspect over time that their readers will think that, too.\" Brown also said that media coverage has become increasingly personal: \"I think that's a mistake, too. Take my recent trip to America. I had meetings every day with Obama, about Iraq, Iran, the economy, global warming, Afghanistan, nuclear power.\" Asked by Morgan about the way the visit to Washington was covered by the British media, which claimed he had been repeatedly snubbed by the president, Brown remarked: \"The journalists there knew what was happening and chose to report it differently. To call it a snub was wrong.\" Talking about coverage of the credit crunch, and the measures the government has taken to tackle its effects, he said: \"I don't think people are reporting what's actually happening. It's frustrating that the issues that matter to the British people in the long run are not being reported properly.\" He added, however, that he did not feel he was being outflanked by the Conservative party and its press operation. \"I wouldn't say I'm losing the media war, no.\" In other comments made in the interview, and released to the media earlier this week, Brown said: \"The BBC has got to seriously consider its salary structure.\" He also said Simon Cowell deserved his multimillion-pound fortune and that he was still an avid viewer of The X Factor. \"Cowell accused me of wavering in my support for The X Factor, but I haven't.

There were predictable exchanges in the second leaders' debate but they were focused on domestic aspects of foreign policy as Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg tried to trip each other up in a pointless point-scoring contest. For four weeks Britain has been on mass-media Valium as far as serious foreign policy issues are concerned. But on 7 May harsh realities will break into the parochial provincialism of British politics. Barack Obama is gunning for one of Britain's key export earners and iconic companies, BP. The Middle East remains poised for all-out conflict as neither Israel nor its Palestinian and wider Arab opponents seem to have any desire or idea on how to make peace. Will prime minister's question time always have to begin with the roll-call of dead in Afghanistan or will a new Commons begin to reflect growing public disquiet about the dead and maimed returning from a region riddled with corruption and terror? Despite the huffing and puffing what will stop foreigners coming to Britain as long as employers refuse to hire British workers, and are the latter willing to do the work that our 24/7 service economy demands? There has been plenty of hubris at the Greek drama. But if Greece defaults, devalues, or the drachma replaces the euro, the consequences will be felt in Britain. A Europe that replaces open-border integration with economic sauve qui peut politics will hit trade. A Britain that says \"no\" to Polish workers can face a Poland – strong and growing under its moderate Civic Platform government – that may say \"no\" to British financial services or Easyjet flights. Why should Italian olive oil exporters who have to price in euros not demand protection against Greek olive oil exporters if they export in a devalued drachma? Wider afield there is no coherent policy to deal with China's demands that it is allowed to export at will without allowing its citizens democratic rights or fair wages. It is 50 years since Harold Macmillan's Wind of Change speech and France, too, is celebrating the half-century of granting nominal independence to all its African colonies. Now China is recolonising Africa as Beijing scrambles to buy raw and precious materials and put African leaders on its payroll. The Department for International Development (DfID) was set up with great fanfare 13 years ago and now has the lion's share of UK spend on international policy. But poverty, corruption and malnutrition has gone up not down in the countries where DfID operates. Meanwhile the BBC World Service faces a 25% cut in its budget as funds are diverted to pay for Adam Smith's overseas operation from the swollen DfID budget. Will Britain continue to replace statecraft by aidcraft? Many diplomats hope that a new Conservative foreign secretary will restore the cuts Labour imposed on the Foreign Office to pay for the increased budgets of DfID, the MoD and the intelligence agencies. They hope in vain as Cameron wants more money for the military, for DfID and for spies. Iran continues its reckless rush to become a nuclear power with no one willing to apply either effective sanctions or make clear other options are on the table. Russia seeks to recreate its Soviet sphere of influence. But as the US and other countries extract gas from shale, questions about Russia's mono-economy emerge as the Russian population dwindles under the Putin-Medvedev neo-authoritarian rule. India is unable to defeat illiteracy, poverty and terrible assaults on women despite having more billionaires and millionaires than any country in Europe. Kashmir remains a burning issue with 70,000 Muslims killed since the Indian army took control of the disputed region 20 years ago. Latin America still have too many trade barriers and too much populist nationalism, as well as unresolved narco-terrorism from outfits like Farc in Colombia. None of these problems merit a mention in our election. After 1945, the Conservative party was the multilateralist, indeed internationalist, party. Churchill called for a \"United States of Europe\". The Tories set up the Council of Europe, supported the creation of Nato, the OECD, GATT (now the WTO), and entry into the EEC, now the EU. The Tories negotiated the first nuclear test ban treaty and the law of the sea treaty. Margaret Thatcher signed the Single European Act and John Major signed the Maastricht treaty. As supporters of open trade capitalism and a Lockeian view of the world based on enforceable contract under law, the Conservatives in government sought to bind the world together by sovereignty-sharing treaties and international law. The failure at Copenhagen to secure a climate change treaty shows how multilateralism is being sidelined in favour of the renationalisation of sovereignty-sharing treaties. This will accelerate after 7 May if Cameron becomes PM. If there is one guiding foreign policy principle to emerge from five years of William Hague's stewardship of Tory foreign policy it is bilateralism in place of multilateralism. Thus implies working with France, not the EU on defence policy even though the French have made clear they want more not less Europe on defence questions. Cameron talked vaguely about building relations with north Africa (Algeria? Libya?) in place of the EU. Cameron has said he wants to repatriate core elements of the Lisbon treaty, including social rights for workers, and common rules on combating transfrontier crime. He wants a sovereignty act to push back the EU. Fair enough. But if 26 other EU nations pass sovereignty acts to repudiate elements of the EU that Britain likes and wants to see upheld, how can an open Europe survive? Cameron is proud of his alliance with homophobic politicians in the European parliament and has placed his Tory MEPs under the orders of a Polish radical rightist who venerates Augusto Pinochet and will not apologise for the massacre of some Jews in wartime Poland. Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel are aghast at this behaviour as well as Cameron's rupture with the decades-long alliance with centre-right parties in Europe. Again this has had no play in the election but will return to haunt Britain if Cameron becomes PM. He has also called for a referendum on any treaty change that affects Britain. This is aimed at placating anti-EU voters and Tory backers like Rupert Murdoch, the Barclay Brothers and their vizier, the anti-European Andrew Neil, as well as Lord Rothermere and his editors. Again, fair enough. But it is impossible to imagine Turkey joining the EU without substantial treaty change. The Tories are nominal supporters of Turkish EU aspirations, but their promise of plebiscites on future EU treaties will torpedo Turkey's putative EU entry hopes. It is hard to imagine Clegg and Chris Huhne and Menzies Campbell supporting Cameron's desire to create a Eurosceptic isolationism as the UK's new foreign policy. And if there is no clear majority in the Commons these undiscussed issues about foreign and EU policy will come to dominate the next political agenda.

Politicians, business leaders, scientists and campaigners alike have welcomed the report, but the electricity producers called the target \"ambitious\" and stressed the need for a new generation of nuclear power plants. Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society \"The government set up the Climate Change Committee to get sound, independent advice. Now it is imperative that it heeds it. If we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we must make serious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. \"The UK can show real leadership on tackling climate change and a key part of this is investing in low carbon technologies. The first step should be to only grant approval for new coal fired power stations on the basis that they will have their operating permits withdrawn unless they are capturing 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. That would also give the UK a head start in developing a green energy technology with huge economic potential.\" Steve Webb, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman \"There is now no excuse for either the government or the Conservative party not to back the Liberal Democrats' amendment to the bill, which calls for 80% cuts by 2050. \"Once a tough target is in place, the rest of government policy must follow suit. It is no good having a target if the rest of government is pointing in the opposite direction. \"Unrestricted airport expansion, new coal-fired power stations and a massive road-building programme will all pump up emissions and are totally incompatible with this new target. \"The test of the new Climate Change department will not be whether it has a trendy new logo, but whether it has the clout to stop other cabinet ministers undermining these vital climate change goals.\" Spokeswoman, Association of Electricity Producers \"It is important that all sectors are engaged in emission reductions and we are pleased that the Climate Change Committee recognises this. By 2030, the power sector is expected to reduce its emissions significantly, but total decarbonisation, as suggested by Lord Turner in his interview, is an ambitious goal. \"Electricity companies are already investing heavily in low-carbon technologies: 5% of the UK's electricity is currently generated by renewables. That is a fast-growing sector. Nuclear power, which at present accounts for around 20% of electricity production, will also be important. If we want to maintain a high level of security of supply and become greener, we will need to look at all technologies, including carbon capture and storage.\" Dr Neil Bentley, CBI director of business environment \"Raising the target to 80% will increase the challenge to business, but we believe that UK firms will continue to rise to this challenge. We agree with the committee's assessment that such a major emissions reduction can be achieved at a manageable cost, but only if the right policies are put in place.\" John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director \"If we are to almost totally decarbonise our electricity sector in the next 20 years, as Turner suggests, then the new climate minister Ed Miliband must focus on cutting-edge renewables, energy efficiency and super-efficient combined heat and power plants. It can be done, but we'll know if this government is serious when they announce whether Heathrow expansion and a new coal plant at Kingsnorth will get the green light. \"A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that a new fleet of coal plants would hole the new target below the water line, while Labour's current ambitions for aviation expansion would finish it off.\" David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK \"We are delighted that the Committee accepts that emissions from aviation and shipping - the fastest growing sectors - must be included in any credible target. \"However, it is crucial that the UK shows true leadership by demonstrating a commitment to deliver a low-carbon economy - through delivering the bulk of emissions reductions in the UK rather than relying excessively on imported carbon credits.\" Greg Clark, the Conservative party shadow climate change secretary \"I am delighted that Lord Turner has brought forward his recommendations which create a more logical framework for further debate about the Climate Change Bill. We have made it clear that the recommendations of the climate change committee will shape the policies pursed by a Conservative government. Meeting an 80% reduction target would present major challenges especially given the government's poor performance in recent years. However, with the right policies, there would be clear economic benefits from ensuring that Britain plays a leading role in creating a greener and safer world.\" Professor Roger Kemp, Lancaster University, and Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering This target \"will be a challenge greater than fighting both the banking crisis and the \"war on terror\" at the same time. And it will go on for decades. \"The engineering challenge is huge but possible, the political challenge will require a level of courage not seen in the present crisis. The government's policy that developing the new [power] stations should be left to the markets is just not plausible – particularly with the banking crash soaking up available funds. If part-nationalisation of banks is considered acceptable, why not at least the same level of state financial guarantees to kick-start the low-carbon energy business?\" Philip Wolfe, Renewable Energy Association \"The vital test of UK commitment to combating climate change is what government does with renewables and energy efficiency right now. We have less than 10 years left to start bringing emissions down if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. We therefore look to the new Department for Energy and Climate Change to back the Renewable Energy Tariff measure in the Energy Bill over the next few weeks. If this is done it will empower everyday people and businesses all over the UK to invest in renewable and significantly contribute to the carbon dioxide cut.\" Andy Atkins, executive director Friends of the Earth \"The committee's advice is fantastic news. If we are to play our part in avoiding a climate catastrophe, the new climate law must require future governments to slash UK emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050. \"The climate change law is a trail-blazing piece of legislation – but the Government must now strengthen the Bill to help make Britain a world leader in developing a low carbon economy. \"But we cannot afford to ignore pollution from international aviation and shipping – that would be like going on a calorie-controlled diet and ignoring the calories from chocolate bars. The Bill currently has a loophole allowing future Government to continue to ignore these emissions - ministers must act to close it.\" Phil Bloomer, Oxfam's director of campaigns and policy \"This report supports what we have been saying for some time. The government must tackle climate change with the same urgency it is showing in confronting the global financial crisis. \"Current economic problems cannot be used as an excuse for inaction. Without action now, the devastating impacts of climate change will dwarf today's economic difficulties, especially for poor people in developing countries, who are being hit first and hardest.\" Merlin Hyman, director of the Environmental Industries Commission \"We welcome the committee's focus on energy efficiency and believe that a step change in the way we use energy in the UK is the cheapest and most effective way of meeting the targets. We urgently need, therefore, a range of policies for securing energy savings right across the economy that are as equally ambitious as today's recommendations.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/feb/07/british-manufacturing-recovery-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-07T00:05:31Z","webTitle":"Manufacturing will forge Britain's recovery – if politicians allow it to","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/07/british-manufacturing-recovery-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/feb/07/british-manufacturing-recovery-economy","fields":{"headline":"Manufacturing will forge Britain's recovery – if politicians allow it to","bodyText":"The adventurer Ranulph Fiennes was an appropriate choice of after-dinner speaker at the biennial gala evening of the manufacturing lobby group the EEF last week. His tales of perilous – and financially precarious – expeditions into hostile terrain must have struck a chord with an audience of manufacturers and exporters. The secrets of Fiennes's success are self-reliance, ingenuity and sheer dogged staying power – all qualities that are also required in British manufacturers. Like our polar explorers, they are a gallant but dwindling breed. Long before the financial sector crisis hogged the headlines, there was a slower, but devastating crisis in manufacturing, with more than a million jobs lost in the sector since Labour came to power, in a drip, drip, drip of misery. The effect of this was masked to some extent by growth in the public sector, but we can no longer count on government job creation to bail out the black hole left in Britain's regions by the decline in manufacturing. There are new signs of life in the sector, where activity in January grew at its fastest pace for 15 years, thanks to a weak pound boosting export sales. But let's not get carried away: it is not possible to march into mothballed factories and simply turn on the lights again. And the job losses continue: cuts have been signalled by AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Royal Dutch Shell, oil company Chevron and Toyota, which announced it needed to shed staff before the recall of vehicles with faulty accelerators. Belatedly, all three political parties are putting manufacturing at the centre of their economic thinking, claiming to recognise that City-philia has led to an unbalanced economy and entrenched regional divides. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, has drawn up a \"new economic model\" which, in his words, \"gets Britain making things again\". He doesn't, of course, mention the devastating effects of Margaret Thatcher's policies on the industrial heartlands of the North and Midlands. Lord Mandelson is a convert to industrial activism, though he doesn't, of course, mention the disdain with which his party seemed to view horny-handed industrial toilers until now. Growth – or the illusion of growth – in the past decade was based upon the financial sector, consumer spending and borrowing linked to a housing bubble, and the expansion of the public sector. None of these, as Osborne points out, will provide it in future, so manufacturing is back in fashion. The rhetoric in itself is quite helpful as it sends out messages, for example, to companies thinking of investing in the UK or to domestic entrepreneurs. Manufacturers make investments which are very long term and very uncertain, so it is helpful to them to know what sort of economy the government is going to encourage. But whichever party comes into power this year will have huge amounts of ground to make up. Budgets will be extremely constrained, so ministers will have to identify a limited number of technologies and markets where the UK has strong potential such as nuclear power, marine renewables or carbon capture and storage. There is also a big issue around the gap in providing very patient capital for industry, which neither the banks nor the venture capital industry are ideally placed to fill; Osborne's green investment bank would have a role to play here. A competitive tax system, a purge of unnecessary red tape, more visibility of senior politicians on the export circuit, all these would help. The biggest change, though, has to be one of mindset. The prevailing philosophy for the past three decades has been that the fate of UK manufacturing is best decided by the markets; it should be blindingly obvious by now that is far too simplistic. Regulator Ofgem's Project Discovery report should be helpful in this respect, with its implication that parking energy supply in the free market has been an unmitigated disaster, and the Cadbury/Kraft affair clearly showed that long-term corporate decisions cannot safely be derogated to shareholders with short-term horizons. Surely it is a no-brainer that governments can make a huge difference in their capacity as regulators, purchasers, suppliers and as influencers of public opinion. They should not be there merely to step in to correct market failures; our next government should be seeking actively to support innovation. As a large customer, government can play an important role in supporting early stage markets. There must also be a rethink on overseas takeovers. We should not be trying to pull up the drawbridge and create a fortress Britain, but it is unacceptable to allow UK companies to be sold for the benefit of a motley crew of investment bankers, PR advisers, outgoing managers, hedge funds and new foreign owners, while disregarding the impact on employees and the industrial fabric of the nation. Mandelson's attempt to intervene in the takeover of Cadbury by Kraft, which was formalised last week, amounted to little. Trades unions are sceptical about the promise by Kraft chief executive Irene Rosenfeld that the deal will result in a net gain of manufacturing jobs in the UK. However well-intentioned he was, Mandelson was undermined by his predecessor, Patricia Hewitt, who in 2002 stripped the public interest criterion out of decisions on takeover bids except for those in the defence, water and newspaper sectors. No political party can watch Cadbury being hamstrung by hedge funds and sold off in a deal of dubious long-term value to the Americans and claim to be a champion of British industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2009/dec/30/30-year-rule-thatcher-papers-released","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-30T00:05:27Z","webTitle":"Papers released under 30 year rule reveal full force of Thatcher's fury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/30-year-rule-thatcher-papers-released","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2009/dec/30/30-year-rule-thatcher-papers-released","fields":{"headline":"Papers released under 30 year rule reveal full force of Thatcher's fury","bodyText":"The arrival of Margaret Thatcher, the Grantham grocer's daughter, as Britain's first female prime minister sent shockwaves not only through Whitehall and Westminster but across the world – even if the Japanese did think she needed a crack squad of \"karate ladies\" to protect her at her first summit. Today, the cabinet papers from Thatcher's earliest days in office are finally released under the 30-year rule. The 1979 files provide a fascinating insight into the way she took a grip, first of her ministers, then the country with a pugnacious style that is revealed in hostile handwritten remarks in the margins of previously secret documents. The Downing Street files show that within a month of taking office Thatcher told Geoffrey Howe, her chancellor, that the two Treasury papers on public spending cuts he put forward for their first budget were \"not nearly tough enough\" and that his proposal to double VAT to 15% would simply stoke inflation. A paper on pay policy by the employment secretary, Jim Prior, was so \"thoroughly deficient in content\" that she ordered it not to be circulated to the cabinet. Again and again her furious handwritten notes in the margins of the files reveal her impatience at the cautious approach of Whitehall and some of the \"wets\" in her own cabinet. \"This will not do\" makes regular appearances, as does \"too small\" whenever public spending cuts are being discussed. She just as often responded with her blue felt-tip pen with the single word \"no\", heavily underlined. Her early struggles to reduce an £8bn public spending borrowing requirement through spending cuts and increases in indirect taxes while cutting the basic rate of income tax to 30p are an object lesson for any incoming prime minister next year faced with a deficit of £176bn. The files show that at her first meeting with the Soviet premier, Alexey Kosygin, the woman they had dubbed the \"iron lady\" lectured him on the plight of the hundreds of thousands of boat people risking their lives fleeing communist Vietnam after he suggested that they were all drug-takers or criminals. \"The prime minister told Mr Kosygin that the refugees who were being picked up by British ships were … hardworking people, not drug addicts, and a high proportion of them were children.\" But the Downing Street papers also disclose a shocking degree of personal racism in her own response to the Vietnamese boat people, initially resisting an informal UN request that Britain take 10,000 refugees on the grounds that there would be riots in the streets if they were given council housing ahead of \"white citizens\". She made clear to her cabinet colleagues that she had \"less objection to refugees such as Rhodesians, Poles and Hungarians, since they could more easily be assimilated into British society\". Mrs Thatcher even bizarrely proposed to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, that they jointly buy an Indonesian island to resettle all the boat people. This forerunner of Oliver Letwin's 2003 idea for an \"asylum island\" to take all of Britain's asylum seekers was only blocked when Singapore complained that it would set up a rival entrepreneurial city. The files disclose that Thatcher's first months in power reveal a torrent of pungent political aphorisms that were to sustain her in power for the next 13 years. Vetoing Lord Carrington's suggestion that Foreign Office negotiators should meet Robert Mugabe before the Rhodesia/Zimbabwe settlement, the prime minister scribbled in the margin of one letter: \"No – Please do not meet leaders of the 'Patriotic Front'. I have never [underlined] done business with terrorists until they become prime ministers. MT\" An enthusiast for nuclear power, Thatcher admitted in a dispatch about Pakistan's ambitions: \"There was little one could do if a country was determined to obtain nuclear weaponry.\" A letter from July 1978, while she was still leader of the opposition, reveals Thatcher's legally inspired reluctance to concede that mistakes had ever been made. Opposing plans to publish a history of military intelligence in the second world war, she observed: \"I was taught a very good rule by my two Masters at Law, both of whom are now judges: never admit anything unless you have to; and then only for specific reasons and within defined limits.\" As for the \"karate ladies\", the cabinet secretary, Sir John Hunt, rejected the Japanese proposal for an all-female protection squad at the Tokyo summit, saying that Thatcher was going as \"prime minister, and not as a woman per se\".

In a second day of debate on energy, Democratic senators today pivoted from the economy to national security to try to make the case for a climate change bill. The threat to Americans' security ranged from the here and now – with troops in Afghanistan and Iraq tied down by their reliance on gas-guzzling equipment – to years into the future when extreme temperatures and rising sea levels could lead to a widespread social breakdown. \"We have never before on this planet had close to 7 billion people which we will have in 2011. We have never had the unprecedented level of per capita energy use multiplied by that 7 billion people,\" Dennis McGinn, a member of the Military Advisory Board, composed of senior retired admirals and generals, told the Senate. \"We have a whole host of indicators, warnings and trends that tells us climate change is bad for national security.\" He said the country would face risks on multiple fronts. \"America's current energy posture constitutes a serious and urgent threat to national security – militarily, diplomatically and economically.\" The Pentagon is already beginning to focus more acutely on the threat posed by climate change. Military research labs are exploring new energy-saving devices, and other ways of conserving fuel in the battlefield. The conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq have made planners acutely conscious that fuel dependence is putting US forces at risk. The US marines corps recently ordered an energy audit of its operations in Afghanistan, in a bid to reduce enormous fuel costs. \"We are tied down by fuel. Fuel is a real day-today concern for our forces in the field who are tethered to that fossil fuel tail,\" said Kathleen Hicks, the deputy undersecretary of defence for strategy. The US military is beginning to focus more intensely on the threat posed by climate change. Hicks also told the Senate that global warming was emerging as a dangerous \"accelerant\" – fuelling conflicts and speeding the breakdown of fragile states. It also created opportunities for extremist groups such as al-Qaida. Progress on the climate change bill is seen as essential a to a successful outcome at the international meeting on carbon reduction in Copenhagen in December. The White House has also stepped up its efforts to shepherd the bill through the Senate. This week's hearings, the formal start of the legislative process, were carefully coordinated with the White House. Obama yesterday toured a solar facility in Florida and announced the award of some $3.5bn (£2.1bn) in grants to modernise America's electrical grid. Today, the White House sponsored a public forum on energy. The White House and Democratic leaders are also trying to rally support around the climate change bill in the Senate – in part by bowing to Republican demands for a larger place for nuclear power. Barbara Boxer, the co-author of the proposed legislation, said today she would press ahead to get her environment and public works committee for early approval of the draft – despite opposition from Republicans and even a powerful Democrat. \"I think there will be good news out of the committee this week, so stay tuned,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2009/apr/29/renewable-energy-david-mackay","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-29T15:09:22Z","webTitle":"Cambridge professor David Mackay on building renewables on a large scale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/apr/29/renewable-energy-david-mackay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2009/apr/29/renewable-energy-david-mackay","fields":{"headline":"Think big on renewables scale","bodyText":"The discussion about energy options tends to be an intensely emotional, polarised, mistrustful, and destructive one. Every option is strongly opposed: the public seem to be anti-wind, anti-coal, anti-waste-to-energy, anti-tidal-barrages, anti-carbon-tax, and anti-nuclear. We can't be anti-everything – we need an energy plan that adds up. But there's a lack of numeracy in the public discussion of energy. Where people do use numbers, they select them to sound big and score points in arguments, rather than to aid thoughtful discussion. I would like to help people have honest and constructive conversations about energy. We need to understand how much energy our modern lifestyles use, decide how much energy we would like to use in the future and choose where we will get that energy from. I think it highlights the scale of the problem if we discuss all forms of energy in simple personal units. In my book, Sustainable Energy – without the hot air, I express everything in kilowatt-hours. One kilowatt-hour (kWh) is the electrical energy used by leaving a 40-watt bulb on for 24 hours. The chemical energy in the food we eat to stay alive amounts to about three kWh per day. Taking one hot bath uses about five kWh of heat. Driving an average car 50km uses 40 kWh of fuel. With a few of these numbers in mind, we can start to evaluate some of the recommendations people make about energy. Take, for example, switching off your mobile phone charger when you are not using it. The truth is that leaving a phone charger switched on uses about 0.01 kWh per day – one hundredth of the power consumed by a lightbulb and the same as driving an average car for one second. Switching off phone chargers is like bailing the Titanic with a teaspoon. I'm not saying you shouldn't switch it off – do switch if off – but realise what a tiny fraction it is of your energy footprint. In total, the European lifestyle uses 125 kWh per day per person for transport, heating, manufacturing, and electricity. That's equivalent to every person having 125 lightbulbs switched on all the time. And most of this energy today comes from fossil fuels. What are our post-fossil-fuel options? Among the energy-saving options, two technology switches look particularly promising. Electric vehicles will help because they can be about four times as energy-efficient as standard fossil-fuel vehicles. There is also the delivery of winter heating and hot water by electric-powered heat pumps (which can be four times as energy-efficient as standard heaters). Among all the energy-supply technologies, the three with the biggest potential are wind power, nuclear power, and solar power. Now let's imagine that technology switches and lifestyle changes manage to halve British energy consumption to 60kWh per day per person. How big would the wind, nuclear, and solar facilities need to be to supply this halved consumption? If we wanted to get one-third of our energy from each of these sources we would have to build wind farms with an area equal to the area of Wales, 50 Sizewells of nuclear power and solar power stations in deserts covering an area twice the size of greater London. I'm not recommending this particular mix of options – there are many mixes that add up. What about tidal power, wave, geothermal, biofuels and hydroelectricity? In such a short article, I can't discuss all the technology options. But the sober message about wind and solar applies to all renewables: much as I love them, they only deliver a small amounts of power. So if we want renewable facilities to supply power on a scale comparable to our consumption, those facilities – whether centralised or decentralised – must be big. Whatever mix you choose, if it adds up, we have a very large building task. The simple wind/nuclear/solar mix I just mentioned would involve roughly a one-hundred-fold increase in wind power, and a five-fold increase in nuclear power; the solar power in deserts would require new long-distance cables connecting the Sahara to Surrey, with a capacity 25 times greater than the existing England-France interconnector. It's not going to be easy to make a energy plan that adds up; but it is possible. We need to get building. • David MacKay is a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Cambridge.

Formerly chief foreign policy adviser to prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the dapper professor dubbed the \"Turkish Kissinger\" has energetically pursued the ruling AKP party's trademark policy of \"zero problems with neighbours\", a policy he first articulated in a 2001 book, Strategic Depth. Given the torrid history of Ottoman involvement in the Balkans, southern Caucasus and the Arab lands, good-neighbourly relations are not a given for modern Turkey. But in the past year, Davutoglu has led a drive to strengthen ties to Iraq's new government, mend fences with Syria (with which Turkey nearly went to war ten years ago), and forge an as yet incomplete rapprochement with Armenia, another ancient foe. Behind this drive lies the belief that Turkey, nearly a century after the Ottoman empire imploded, is destined once again to become a regional power with global influence. For Davutoglu, this ambition entails a \"comprehensive\" approach embracing enhanced economic, cultural and social ties as well as political and security relations. Hence Turkey's multiplying regional trade and energy deals, not least with Russia, and its lifting of visa requirements for citizens of Syria, Lebanon, Romania and several other countries. Not everyone wants to be friends. Interviewed in London yesterday ahead of a meeting with foreign secretary David Miliband, Davutoglu spoke of three complex challenges where progress in 2010 remains problematic. The first is Cyprus, where long-running, UN-brokered talks on reunification are inching towards some sort of denouement. Analysts suggest that if a deal is not done by April, when presidential elections are due in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, all bets are off. \"We have reached an historic moment in the negotiations. That's one reason for coming to London now,\" Davutoglu said, noting Britain's role as a guarantor of any settlement. The Turkish Cypriot side had introduced a promising new package last week, he said, including a so-called \"cross voting\" scheme that would give the two communities a quota in each other's elections. Although the initial Greek Cypriot reaction was to reject the package, Davutoglu insisted that was not the end of the matter. \"We know first of all the Greek Cypriots always say 'No!' Then they say 'No-o-o'. Then they say 'No-maybe' ... I am optimistic. We need an intensified international effort by the EU, by the UN, by both sides, and by Greece and Turkey and Britain as guarantors, like we had in 2004.\" He had personally contacted US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and the UN secretary-general to generate momentum for a deal, he said. Meanwhile, the Turkish and Greek Cypriot presidents had embarked on six day-long negotiating sessions to try and find a way through. Turning to Iran, a particular British preoccupation, Davutoglu said his advice to Miliband, if asked, would be to eschew more public name-calling and pursue discreet negotiations on the nuclear issue and other matters of concern. He said Turkey was at pains to maintain a friendly relationship with its Persian neighbour. \"The situation in Iran is not good, is not compatible with our vision,\" Davutoglu said. \"We don't want nuclear proliferation in the region, we don't want nuclear weapons in Iran or Israel or anywhere. Second, every country has the right to pursue nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Third, we also don't want more sanctions [on Iran]. Sanctions hurt ordinary people and neighbouring countries. \"We don't forget the very bad experience in Iraq. We would advise intensified negotiations through diplomacy. An absence of mutual trust is the problem.\" If asked, Turkey would be happy to facilitate a constructive dialogue with Iran, he said. Davutoglu reserved his sharpest words for Israel, with which Turkey, unusually, has enjoyed cordial relations in the past but with which Erdogan fell out noisily after last year's attack on Gaza. Verbal hostilities resumed this week after the Turkish prime minister called Israel a threat to peace and accused it of acting disproportionately. Israel hit back angrily, in effect telling Erdogan to mind his own business. \"When Israel follows a policy of peace, we have good relations,\" Davutoglu said. Before Gaza, Turkey had mediated indirect talks between Syria and Israel and made \"remarkable\" progress, he said. But the Israeli incursion had scuppered the talks. \"That attack changed many things ... It created a very unstable situation in the region\" that even Barack Obama had been unable to overcome. Since then, there had been further \"provocations\" such as additional Jewish settlement building in east Jerusalem. \"If Israel wants peace, they must learn that others have rights that must be respected,\" he said. Davutoglu pauses and smiles. But it's clear that when it comes to Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, there are limits to even his highly developed sense of good-neighbourliness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2008/aug/13/britishenergy.edf.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-13T07:11:29Z","webTitle":"Nuclear: British Energy and EDF still in talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/britishenergy.edf.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/aug/13/britishenergy.edf.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"British Energy and EDF still in talks","bodyText":"British Energy, which has been at the centre of intense takeover speculation for several months, said this morning that it remained in advanced talks with a potential bidder. The company did not name its suitor but it has been an open secret that it is France's state controlled EDF. Last month EDF and British Energy came within a whisker of agreeing terms but the move failed when two key shareholders said a 765p bid would not be enough. This threw the government's plans to construct a new generation of nuclear power stations into confusion. British Energy operates eight nuclear power stations and one coal-fired plant. This morning its chief executive, Bill Coley, said: \"As we continue discussions in respect of a potential transaction, we remain clear that the expertise of our people, together with our sites, makes British Energy uniquely positioned to play a pivotal role in nuclear new build.\" The government, which has a 36% stake in the business, is keen to see nuclear new build as part of what it sees as a balanced portfolio of electricity generation, including renewables, gas and cleaner coal. It would have backed the EDF terms which valued the business at more than £12bn. British Energy is a key player in any new nuclear programme because land at its existing sites is seen as the most likely location for new power stations. Though EDF has always been the front runner in the battle for British Energy, Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, is keen to play a role. It has held talks with EDF about taking a 25% stake in British Energy in the wake of a successful EDF bid for British Energy and has also said it could look at a bid of its own if no one else made an offer. This morning British Energy said that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the first three months of the financial year fell from £253m to £129m. The company blamed lower output and the higher costs of work at two plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2009/mar/18/nuclear-power-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-18T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"George Monbiot: Berry's nuclear fallout has lost her my vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/mar/18/nuclear-power-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/mar/18/nuclear-power-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Berry's nuclear fallout has lost her my vote","bodyText":"Here's the stupidest comment I have ever read about nuclear power. Siân Berry is a big cheese in the Green party, for which I have mostly voted over the past few years. I'll be thinking very hard about it from now on. She starts by praising three of the remarkable women who have been making waves on climate change and other issues: Tamsin Omond, Ariane Sherine and Leila Deen. I too admire them immensely. I believe that Tamsin and Leila should both be declared national treasures: Tamsin for her rooftop protest on the Houses of Parliament, Leila for covering Peter Mandelson with green custard. Siân immodestly claims membership of this band of \"gloriously brilliant young women\" on the grounds that, not a dozen years ago, she put some fake parking tickets on some 4x4s. Emmeline Pankhurst eat your bloody heart out. Anyway, she contrasts these inspiring people with \"the alpha males of the green movement\": Mark Lynas, Chris Goodall, Stephen Tindale and myself. Unlike her and her heroes, we have committed the cardinal sin of becoming open-minded about nuclear power. But worse, far worse, we have \"a tendency to be over 45 with the haircut of a WW2 fighter pilot\". Yes, I do have that tendency. Try as I might, I can't help myself — being 46 is one of my bad habits. As for the haircut, I won't try to justify it, except to say that it gives Johnny Hun a fright. But the problem, apparently, is that \"combined with their deep voices and 1940s haircuts, this rhetoric from the alpha males frames the issue in a 'practical expert versus excitable hysteric' narrative that is very hard to counteract if you are following one of them in a debate and are young and female. No matter how much science you can quote, you're never going to get people to think you are making sense in that context if you look like an MMR-shy mum.\" And that, dear reader, is the extent of the argument. By aggressively wearing our hair in a public place, we are depriving young women of the chance to speak about the energy choices this country faces. As if to make the point, Siân, evidently cowed by our horrible hair, fails to make a single coherent statement about why nuclear power is not the way to go. Instead she argues that because I have stuck it to the supermarkets, Mark has documented climate change around the world and Stephen once advocated microgeneration, we shouldn't discuss it. Thus she introduces three remarkable propositions: 1. That young women are incapable of engaging in practical discussions about energy policy. 2. That certain subjects are out of bounds. 3. That our haircuts are an instrument of oppression. Pretty good for one short blog: sexism, ageism, a demand for self-censorship, discrimination on the grounds of appearance and sheer blithering absurdity. So who the heck do I vote for now?

Saltholme is like an area of East Anglian fenland, surrounded by the steel and concrete citadels of petrochemical refineries pouring plumes of steam and smoke into a louring sky as flocks of golden plover wheel over rippling pools. \"I've been attracted to this place for 12 years,\" says David Kitchen, chair of the Teesside Environment Trust (TET), \"and I'm always surprised by the beauty of the landscape.\" Saltholme is a 380-hectare (1,000 acre) nature reserve of ponds and grassland between Hartlepool and Billingham, near Middlesbrough, on the flatlands of the Tees estuary. It is owned by the TET and run by the RSPB as a wild bird discovery centre. Opened last month, Saltholme is the culmination of many years and £4m-worth of landscape and building work. Internationally important for wading birds and wildfowl, it has been designed as a visitor attraction for a wide audience. \"There are 600,000 people in Teesside and we need a place like this,\" Kitchen says. \"It's the meld of industry and nature that makes this reserve so distinctive and so relevant to the people here.\" Kevin Bayes, RSPB project manager, adds: \"This place is about the rejuvenation of family-friendly wildlife watching. People who are not keen birders can feel intimidated by the wooden hides for watching birds on nature reserves, but here we have created open, friendly buildings and designed habitats so people can get close to wildlife.\" There's a flurry of excitement as telescopes are aimed at a red-throated diver in the pond outside. It's the first time this elegantly angular bird from arctic Scandinavia has been seen here, but Saltholme is famous for rare visitors. When a glaucus-winged gull from Alaska appeared recently, so did 2,000 twitchers. But it's really the audience for wildlife generated by television programmes such as Springwatch that the centre aims to attract, and a lot of hi-tech audio visual kit is being installed to coax that audience from the televisual image into the real thing. Even on a squally February morning, there's a lot of the real thing about. Hefty Canada geese, startled by a peregrine falcon, bugle over the newly planted reed beds; pintail, shoveller and mallard ducks scud about the pools, whose levels are raised and lowered by sluices, depending on what species turn up; the cries of curlews haunt the far edges, and flocks of lapwing and golden plover rise and fall into sheep- and cattle-grazed grassland. The island at Paddy's Hole - a pond named after its digger driver - may have a couple of coots on it now, but soon there'll be 300 pairs of terns nesting on the heat-retaining shells brought in from the Norfolk coast. Rumour has it that otters have come back, there are hares, water shrews and water voles, and it is hoped that grayling and clouded yellow butterflies will return. All this wildlife seems even more extraordinary given the industrial landscape that surrounds it. There are cooling towers and chimneys, steel columns venting flame, a nuclear power station, the twin towers that produce Quorn, a Saudi industrial chemical complex, an incinerator plant, oil refineries and dockyards. It may appear to be an inhospitable place, but wildlife and industry have been interlinked here for centuries. The keys to both are water and salt. What is now the Saltholme reserve was once salt marsh. It was reclaimed as agricultural land, but during the 1820s became what Kitchen calls \"the Victorian Klondike for salt\". Underground reserves of salt were extracted by boreholes, which still pepper the site. The industrial exploitation of salt for caustic soda kick-started the chemical industry, and Saltholme was part of the estate belonging to the company that later became ICI. When TET took over, thousands of tonnes of toxic waste had to be buried and capped with clay. Kitchen says: \"It's ironic that we spent so much effort and money cleaning the place up, when just behind that huge crane over there is the Clemenceau.\" This is the French aircraft carrier, containing 700 tonnes of asbestos-contaminated materials, which arrived last week to be broken up in the same yard as the US navy ghost ships a few years ago. This once proud ship-building area is now a breaker of notorious toxic wrecks. Carol Gowland, who grew up in the 1950s in one of the nearby villages now called the Clarences, says: \"The local newspaper said we lived in dirty slums and this was a bad place, just because it was back-to-back houses with outside toilets. But we loved this place. We'd play here, even though it was forbidden because of the dangerous drainage ditches. But no one ever drowned. It was our wilderness. We could run free, pick a few wildflowers, listen to all the skylarks.\" Restored community Gowland sees the Saltholme project as contributing to the restoration of a distinctive Teesside community, as well as restoration of the environment. She says: \"This is the first step in getting some pride back. Industry has protected this place, rather than ruining it. We want to preserve the wilderness and get the skylarks back. This is about our identity, but you have to know where you are. The river is our identity.\" The Tees still drives the ecology of place s that have weathered change and survived as refuges for wildlife. It remains to be seen if the RSPB's business model for Saltholme will deliver the wildlife experience it envisions, but the signs are positive. The importance of brownfield sites to conservation and the importance of wildlife to social and economic regeneration are now recognised, but it requires imagination and resources to work on a scale that really makes a difference. If an endorsement were needed at Saltholme, few could be more ringing than the presence of the red-throated diver, cruising a pool that sparkles under a brightening winter sky, oblivious to the thrill it is causing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/may/28/who-nuclear-power-chernobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-28T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Toxic link: the WHO and the IAEA | Oliver Tickell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/28/who-nuclear-power-chernobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/may/28/who-nuclear-power-chernobyl","fields":{"headline":"Toxic link: the WHO and the IAEA","bodyText":"Fifty years ago, on 28 May 1959, the World Health Organisation's assembly voted into force an obscure but important agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency – the United Nations \"Atoms for Peace\" organisation, founded just two years before in 1957. The effect of this agreement has been to give the IAEA an effective veto on any actions by the WHO that relate in any way to nuclear power – and so prevent the WHO from playing its proper role in investigating and warning of the dangers of nuclear radiation on human health. The WHO's objective is to promote \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\", while the IAEA's mission is to \"accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world\". Although best known for its work to restrict nuclear proliferation, the IAEA's main role has been to promote the interests of the nuclear power industry worldwide, and it has used the agreement to suppress the growing body of scientific information on the real health risks of nuclear radiation. Under the agreement, whenever either organisation wants to do anything in which the other may have an interest, it \"shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement\". The two agencies must \"keep each other fully informed concerning all projected activities and all programs of work which may be of interest to both parties\". And in the realm of statistics – a key area in the epidemiology of nuclear risk – the two undertake \"to consult with each other on the most efficient use of information, resources, and technical personnel in the field of statistics and in regard to all statistical projects dealing with matters of common interest\". The language appears to be evenhanded, but the effect has been one-sided. For example, investigations into the health impacts of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine on 26 April 1986 have been effectively taken over by IAEA and dissenting information has been suppressed. The health effects of the accident were the subject of two major conferences, in Geneva in 1995, and in Kiev in 2001. But the full proceedings of those conferences remain unpublished – despite claims to the contrary by a senior WHO spokesman reported in Le Monde Diplomatique. Meanwhile, the 2005 report of the IAEA-dominated Chernobyl Forum, which estimates a total death toll from the accident of only several thousand, is widely regarded as a whitewash as it ignores a host of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies indicating far higher mortality and widespread genomic damage. Many of these studies were presented at the Geneva and Kiev conferences but they, and the ensuing learned discussions, have yet to see the light of day thanks to the non-publication of the proceedings. The British radiation biologist Keith Baverstock is another casualty of the agreement, and of the mindset it has created in the WHO. He served as a radiation scientist and regional adviser at the WHO's European Office from 1991 to 2003, when he was sacked after expressing concern to his senior managers that new epidemiological evidence from nuclear test veterans and from soldiers exposed to depleted uranium indicated that current risk models for nuclear radiation were understating the real hazards. Now a professor at the University of Kuopio, Finland, Baverstock finally published his paper in the peer-reviewed journal Medicine, Conflict and Survival in April 2005. He concluded by calling for \"reform from within the profession\" and stressing \"the political imperative for freely independent scientific institutions\" – a clear reference to the non-independence of his former employer, the WHO, which had so long ignored his concerns. Since the 21st anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in April 2007, a daily \"Hippocratic vigil\" has taken place at the WHO's offices in Geneva, organised by Independent WHO to persuade the WHO to abandon its the WHO-IAEA Agreement. The protest has continued through the WHO's 62nd World Health Assembly, which ended yesterday, and will endure through the executive board meeting that begins today. The group has struggled to win support from WHO's member states. But the scientific case against the agreement is building up, most recently when the European Committee on Radiation Risk (ECRR) called for its abandonment at its conference earlier this month in Lesvos, Greece. At the conference, research was presented indicating that as many as a million children across Europe and Asia may have died in the womb as a result of radiation from Chernobyl, as well as hundreds of thousands of others exposed to radiation fallout, backing up earlier findings published by the ECRR in Chernobyl 20 Years On: Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident. Delegates heard that the standard risk models for radiation risk published by the International Committee on Radiological Protection (ICRP), and accepted by WHO, underestimate the health impacts of low levels of internal radiation by between 100 and 1,000 times – consistent with the ECRR's own 2003 model of radiological risk (The Health Effects of Ionising Radiation Exposure at Low Doses and Low Dose Rates for Radiation Protection Purposes: Regulators' Edition). According to Chris Busby, the ECRR's scientific secretary and visiting professor at the University of Ulster's school of biomedical sciences: \"The subordination of the WHO to IAEA is a key part of the systematic falsification of nuclear risk which has been under way ever since Hiroshima, the agreement creates an unacceptable conflict of interest in which the UN organisation concerned with promoting our health has been made subservient to those whose main interest is the expansion of nuclear power. Dissolving the WHO-IAEA agreement is a necessary first step to restoring the WHO's independence to research the true health impacts of ionising radiation and publish its findings.\" Some birthdays deserve celebration – but not this one. After five decades, it is time the WHO regained the freedom to impart independent, objective advice on the health risks of radiation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2008/jun/21/oil.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-20T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"PM tries to persuade Opec to invest 'oil shock' trillions in west's green energy revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/21/oil.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jun/21/oil.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"PM tries to persuade Opec to invest 'oil shock' trillions in west's green energy revolution","bodyText":"Gordon Brown will today plead with Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to channel some of their $3trn profits from the worst \"oil shock\" in history into wind, tidal and nuclear power in Britain and other western countries. On the eve of a visit to a special summit on the oil crisis in Jeddah, the prime minister set out a two-pronged plan that would help wean the west off cripplingly expensive oil, and allow Opec countries to benefit from new environmentally friendly energy sources being developed in the west. Under his \"New Deal\" plan, which Brown set out in a Guardian interview as he prepared to fly to Jeddah this afternoon: · Saudi Arabia and other oil producers, who are worried about the unpredictability of oil prices, which fell to $10 a barrel a decade ago, would be given the chance to take a major financial stake in the more stable market of renewable energy power in the west. · Britain and other western countries would help to improve the supply of oil in the long term by being given greater chances to invest in oilfields and oil refineries in Opec countries. The prime minister told the Guardian: \"I am going to Saudi to see if we can get a new deal between oil producers and the consumers where oil producers will invest in countries like ours, and oil consumers like us with good companies with good technology and skills can invest in the oil-producing countries. Where we can make credible commitments and the world can see we will reduce our dependence on oil and we will get demand and supply back into balance.\" Speaking on the Eurostar on his return to Britain from the EU summit in Brussels, he insisted that he was not going to Saudi Arabia with a simple demand for Opec countries to increase the supply of oil. Rising demand for oil in China and India - the prime minister pointed out that an extra 8m cars appear every year in China - mean that a longer term solution is needed after oil has trebled in price to around $135 a barrel in the past year. \"It is changing the terms of the debate about oil that I think is the key to tackling what is the biggest of all three oil shocks. I don't think people have yet realised that if you have oil priced at $10 ten years ago and $135 today, and even in the last year the price has trebled, you've got a major shock. \"We have had some of the benefits of globalisation with cheaper consumer goods and lower interest rates. Now we are going to have to deal with the downside of globalisation, which is the restructuring of our economies and the pressure on our resources.\" Brown, who briefed fellow EU leaders on his plan at the Brussels summit, said that oil producers had already started to invest in renewable energy sources in Britain. He believes it is possible to attract investment because he has promised that renewable energy, which accounted for 4% of British electricity in 2006, will increase by 700%. He gave three examples: Bahrain is investing in wind and in electricity, including the offshore wind farm in North Hoyle, off the north Wales coast; Qatar is investing in downstream gas; Dubai has invested in British ports. \"Over the next three years I think we will see large investments in Britain in solar, wind power, wave power, nuclear and in expansion of alternatives to oil. The world is going to have to build 1,000 nuclear power stations.\" Brown believes that his two-pronged plan will show that he is developing long-term plans in the face of a major global downturn and rising inflation driven by dramatic increases in food, energy and fuel prices. With Labour trailing on 23% in one recent poll, Brown brushed off criticism of his leadership, which will come into focus next week when he marks his first year in Downing Street. The prime minister said he understood the pain people are feeling: \"We have got to understand that at the petrol pumps or in the supermarkets people are feeling the pressures of oil and food prices are bearing down on them. \"This is a problem in every country of the world where standards of living have been hit. We can do something as a government. We have tried with the winter fuel allowance. But everybody knows that underlying what has happened to the oil price is [that] demand is ahead of supply and you've got to do something about that. Global change is the dominant force in that.\" David Cameron attempted to outflank Brown on low carbon energy last week when he announced that a Tory government would effectively block new coal-fired power stations unless they incorporate new clean technology known as carbon capture and storage. This strips out CO2 and buries it deep underground to prevent global warming. Brown said Britain is bidding to host the first - and then a further two - of 12 EU carbon capture and storage demonstration sites, which will each cost £1bn. \"The issue is three carbon capture and storage [plants], which is £3bn, which I didn't see them properly funding in the short term. The sums have got to add up. The Conservatives are not very clear.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/nov/10/simon-hoggart-product-placement-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-10T00:05:24Z","webTitle":"Simon Hoggart's sketch | No more of that sedentary chuntering, if you please","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/10/simon-hoggart-product-placement-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/nov/10/simon-hoggart-product-placement-labour","fields":{"headline":"No more of that sedentary chuntering, if you please","bodyText":"It's awful, watching the death throes of a government. Yesterday Ben Bradshaw, the creepy culture secretary, announced that ministers were \"minded\" to allow product placement on TV. This is to help the people who run commercial television make more money, because this government has never met a rich man – bankers, the Murdochs or broadcasters in temporary trouble – whom it didn't like. Now, as it reaches its twilight months, the government is doing them another favour. Mr Bradshaw's predecessor said that product placement should stay banned. Mr Bradshaw disagrees. Product placement happens when companies pay to have their stuff used on screen. It starts with someone on Coronation Street using the brand of tea whose makers have paid top whack to have it in shot, even if it's Twinings Lapsang Souchong rather than Asda own brand. It can be subtle. Nobody says: \"Let's talk about this over a glass of Blossom Hill, the wine that makes you delightfully pissed for next to nothing.\" Instead they'll pour a glass, and their friend will say: \"Mmm, this is good! What is it?\" Close-up of the label. In short it is a form of corruption, by which elements of our favourite shows are covertly sold off to the highest bidder without our being told. And a Labour government wants to bring it in. Someone jokily said yesterday that the notion might extend to parliament, and there would be an advert on top of the Speaker's chair. Yeah, right, and MPs will break into their speeches to say, \"I couldn't keep going without the soothing effect of a Fisherman's Friend, the lozenge that massages tired throats.\" The idea of ads in parliament was greeted with some hilarity. Of course nothing like this will happen. The Commons is far too jealous of what dignity it has left. It's only riffraff like us who exist to be manipulated to make wealthy people even wealthier. To be fair, the Speaker himself would not allow any such thing. Last week he interrupted the prime minister twice to tell him to stick to the subject. Yesterday he told Tory MPs to shut their yaps. The government was defending some dodgy cover-up over immigration statistics and opposition MPs were angry and kept talking among themselves. Mr Bercow told them to \"stop wittering\". Then he turned on Richard Ottaway, the Tory MP for Croydon South. He had, the Speaker said, \"just toddled into the chamber\". Mr Ottaway furiously gestured that he had been there quite some time. The Speaker was unbowed. \"I do not want to hear any sedentary chuntering!\" he said, making it sound like those elderly men who talk to themselves on buses. The sedentary chunterer himself looked even angrier, and after a short while marched out of the chamber, upright and in silence. Finally we had the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, explain that after only 12 and a half years delay, the government was going to speed up the planning process for lots more nuclear power stations. It was, we gathered, an emergency. If we didn't get the power stations, the lights would start going out. He actually came close to admitting that turbines, with their \"intermittent wind\" (this sounded like a much-loved but elderly dog that lies in front of the fire turning the air in the sitting room foul) were a waste of time and money. But these monstrosities have never been there to provide quantities of clean power. Turbines are the cathedrals of the green religion, huge, vastly expensive and largely useless symbols of faith. However, unlike wind turbines, most cathedrals are beautiful.

He is going to a UN conference in New York, standing in for the prime minister (David Cameron thought he would be on paternity leave now when the diaries were being arranged) although, wisely perhaps, this was not something he chose to boast about in his big speech yesterday. Patrick Wintour's Guardian story about the speech is here and Polly Toynbee delivers her verdict here. Here's what's on the agenda at the Lib Dem conference today. 9am: Debate on localism. 9.55am: Speech from Lord McNally, justice minister 10.15am: Debate on fairness and austerity. 11.20am: Debate on gay marriage. 12.20pm: Speech by Simon Hughes, deputy Lib Dem leader 2.30pm: Q&amp;A session on public services, with Sarah Teather, Paul Burstow, Andrew Stunell and Steve Webb. 3.15pm: Speech by Chris Huhne, energy secretary. And we'll hear more from Nick Clegg before he leaves for the US. He's on the Today programme now. 8.24am: On the Today programme Justin Webb has been giving Nick Clegg quite a hard time over his claim that tax avoidance (which is legal) is \"morally questionable\". Webb asked him if he thought it was immoral to employ an accountant to minimise your tax bill. No, replied Clegg. What I'm saying is that it is the duty of government to make sure that the complexities in the tax system that we inherited from Gordon Brown are minimised so that the opportunity [for tax avoidance] does not arise. 8.44am: Bankers could face a new tax on their bonuses if they award themselves \"sky-high\" payments, Nick Clegg has just said. The Today programme is over and it ended with a clear warning to the banks. Clegg had to retreat slightly on the issue of tax avoidance, I felt. He made it clear that he was not attacking individuals who used accountants to minimise their tax bills; he was criticising the system that gave people an incentive to do this. And he quoted the figures out last week showing the Treasury is losing £42bn a year because of uncollected tax. But, on bonuses, Clegg went on the offensive. If the banks pay themselves unjustified bonuses, we reserve the right to take very serious action on that. Asked if that was a warning to the banks, he said. Of course it is. Of course it is. I think it would be not in their interests at all, both socially and economically, for them to be starting to award themselves sky-high [bonuses]. Clegg said that the last government imposed a one-off tax on bonuses and that repeating this was an option. It is incredibly important that the banks understand that you cannot possibly award yourselves ludicrous, sky-high bonuses in an industry that has been bailed out by the taxpayer when those same taxpayers are now having to make very serious sacrifices in their own lives ... If you abuse the generosity of taxpayers, who have provided both directly and indirectly a massive infusion of public funds to bail you out, by awarding yourselves bonuses which will appear as almost gratuitously offensive, then clearly this government won't be able to stand idly by. 9.01am: In an interview on BBC Breakfast Clegg was asked about a story in the Daily Telegraph saying that the Lib Dem energy secretary, Chris Huhne, is backing plans \"to increase environmental levies by £15bn to free hundreds of thousands of people from income tax\". In a front-page story, the Telegraph said this was equivalent to an extra £800 from every taxpayer. The Telegraph produced its figures by extrapolating from a motion passed yesterday, with Huhne's support, saying the the government should be raising 10% of its revenue from green taxes by 2015. Clegg said the story was \"creative mathematics\". 9.25am: The Daily Mail has also been trying to calculate the cost of the Lib Dem green tax policy. The Daily Telegraph came up with a figure of £15bn (see 9.01am), but the Mail have got it up to £22bn. 9.37am: David Laws, the Lib Dem who resigned over expenses allegations after less than three weeks as chief secretary to the Treasury, is writing a book, Andrew Pierce reports in the Daily Mail conference diary. It will be called 22 Days in May. 9.48am: The Observer's Andrew Rawnsley is interviewing Lord Ashdown at a fringe event at the conference this evening. The Guardian's video team have produced a profile of Ashdown that will be shown at the event. Here it is. It's well worth watching. 10.10am: The Lib Dems have just passed a motion on localism saying that eventually 75% of local government spending should be raised locally. I suppose that means the Telegraph and the Daily Mail may be running stories to tomorrow about the Lib Dems backing an exorbitant rise in council tax. The motion also calls for the immediate return of business rate revenues to local government and for proportional representation to be introduced for local government elections in England. 10.10am: Lord McNally, the Lib Dem justice minister (and one of Westminster's great survivors - he used to work for Jim Callaghan), is speaking in the conference now. He started with a nice story about how he got a call from David Cameron asking him to join the government. He did not tell Cameron that his wife had already heard about the appointment on Sky News. 10.34am: Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, said today that energy companies will no longer be allowed to use a loophole that allows them to wait 65 days before telling customers that prices have gone up. I want to make sure that the energy companies never again raise prices without telling consumers. Sometimes they've raised prices and they've gone 65 days in a winter without actually telling householders that they're putting up their gas and electricity bills. That's outrageous - householders need to be able to make adjustments. At the moment energy companies are allowed to wait for up to 65 days before they notify customers about price changes. Ofgem is consulting on plans to change this. Huhne said that if Ofgem did not act, he would intervene himself. 10.52am: You can read today's Guardian politics stories here. And the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, I've already mentioned the Telegraph/Mail stories about green taxes. (See 9.01am and 9.25am). Here are three other articles that I found particularly interesting. • Greg Hurst in the Times (paywall) says that Charles Kennedy is poised to lose his role as a leading figure in the alternative vote campaign amid rumours of ill health. Mr Kennedy was to feature as a high-profile advocate of the \"Yes\" campaign for next year's referendum on voting reform, but one senior Liberal Democrat said last night: \"I don't think you can rely on him for anything.\" Doubts about his political future resurfaced after he pulled out of the fourth event since Saturday. He was due to appear first at an eve of conference rally but cancelled, citing problems with his train,… Four years ago Mr Kennedy, who had received treatment for alcoholism while he was party leader, pledged that he would never drink again. Friends admit, though, that he has struggled to keep his promise and acknowledge that there are days when he is \"below par\". • Steve Richards in the Independent says he is certain that there will be no pact between the Tories and the Lib Dems at the general election. In the 1980s the Liberals and the SDP fell out more over who should contest seats than any other issue and they were fighting as a single force. There will be no formal deal with the Conservatives over seats at the next election. • Philip Stephens in the Financial Times (subscription) says that many Lib Dems do not accept Nick Clegg's definition of liberalism. Mr Clegg draws inspiration from John Stuart Mill, marrying social liberalism to limited interference in the economic lives of citizens. Many in his party prefer the party's 20th century icons John Maynard Keynes and William Beveridge – champions of active government as an architect of progress. Mill would have applauded Mr Clegg's strategy of lifting those on low incomes out of the tax net. Keynes would have cautioned against rapid fiscal retrenchment, and Beveridge would have noticed that the poorest gain least from income tax cuts. 10.56am: Figures out today show that government borrowing hit a record high in August. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the full story. 11.14am: The Lib Dems are debating \"ensuring fairness in a time of austerity\". Bob Russell, the Colchester MP, delivered a critical speech wearing a bright yellow waistcoat. (He said he wanted to make a point about the Lib Dems retaining their identity.) He said that he was disappointed that Nick Clegg did not address the issue of child poverty in his conference speech yesterday and he said: \"I do not accept that cuts are fair.\" Talking about fair cuts was a \"contradiction in terms\", he said. He also said that some of the letters and emails he had received from people worried about benefit cuts included one from someone who was contemplating suicide because she was worried about what was coming. Russell was followed by a delegate called Ros Kayes, who was much more blunt. She said she was worried about George Osborne \"running rampage\" through the welfare system \"like the reaper of death\". She also said that Osborne's comments about people living on benefits as a \"lifestyle choice\" were \"sickening and contemptible\". 11.33am: I've just read Lord McNally's speech in full. It's on the Lib Dem website. It's not very newsy, but it's a pleasure to read a speech that includes quotes from Lord Bingham, John Stuart Mill and Magna Carta. 11.39am: The Lib Dems have passed the \"ensuring fairness in a time of austerity\" motion. It includes a line saying the government should ensure that welfare cuts are progressive, \"reducing benefits enjoyed by the most affluent before cutting benefits for the poorest and most vulnerable\". 11.50am: The Lib Dems are now debating a motion calling for gay couples to be allowed to get married, and for mixed-sex couples to be allowed to enter civil partnerships. It was proposed by the former MP Evan Harris. He said this was an issue where the Lib Dems needed to \"test\" the Conservative party's commitment to gay rights. 11.53am: Stephen Gilbert, the Lib Dem MP for St Austell and Newquay, has written a blog for the Independent explaining why he backs the equal marriage motion. 12.15pm: The \"fairness\" motion passed by the conference earlier (see 11.39am) also included a passage on child benefit. It said that the party should: Safeguard universal child benefit in conjunction with progressive taxation in order to provide a reliable source of income protection throughout childhood. But the Treasury could still cut child benefit without contradicting this commitment. There has been speculation about George Osborne scrapping child benefit payments for children over the age of 16. That would cut the amount of money that many parents receive, without altering child benefit's status as a universal benefit. 12.20pm: In an interview for ITV, Nick Clegg has said that some public concerns about the impact of the planned spending cuts have \"run ahead of reality\". Crucially, what has been forgotten, and I think it's right for me to say maybe some of the public fears have run ahead of reality, is that we are doing this over a five-year period of time. So when you talk about 25% cuts – Labour, by the way, talked about 20% cuts - actually in reality that's 6% every year over the next four years or so. 12.24pm: Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, is speaking now. He is starting with tributes to Sir Cyril Smith and Lord Livsey, two prominent Lib Dems who have both died recently. 12.47pm: Simon Hughes has just finished his speech. Here are the main points: • He told the Lib Dems not to complain about being in government. He said that while he understood the \"concerns\" about some aspects of coalition policy, being in government was much better than the alternative. I have been on the opposition benches for 27 years watching things I didn't like and it didn't make it any easier for me or my south London constituents to suffer those things just because I knew I was not in any way responsible. When you move from the touchline to the pitch, there is a risk you may get some knocks and pick up a few bruises – but on the touchline you never get the chance to change the game. Now that we are in the game, one thing that we can say with absolute certainty is that from now we will not be ignored. • He paid lavish tribute to Nick Clegg. Hughes has not always been seen as the world's most supportive deputy – in the past he has repeatedly signalled his unease about aspects of coalition policy – but today he said this about Clegg: We could not at this most important year in our party's history have wished for a leader with greater determination, energy and integrity and, yes, ambition – ambition not for himself, but for the party we all love and determination for the liberty and social justice which Liberal Democrats work daily to achieve. • He described himself as a \"rock-solid\" supporter of the coalition. He also signalled that he expected it to last until 2015. He said the party had democratically agreed that the coalition would last five years. • He said it was vital for the Lib Dems to change their selection rules to get minority ethnic candidates into parliament. The party is debating proposed rule changes tomorrow that would ensure that at least one minority ethnic candidate has to be on the shortlist when candidates are being chosen for winnable seats. Hughes also said he wanted more women standing as candidates. • He criticised France and Italy. He took swipes at French policy towards the Roma, and the Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, in a passage about the role a strong liberal party can play: Liberals in government are really important and not just here. If France had a really strong liberal party I believe there would be no risk of mass expulsions of the Roma people. If Italy had a really strong liberal party I believe it would not have had a prime minster who shamefully legislated to protect himself from the proper workings of justice. 1.03pm: Before Hughes spoke, the Lib Dems passed the motion calling for gay couples to be allowed to marry and for mixed-sex couples to be allowed to enter a civil partnership. According to Pink News, Stonewall are opposed because they fear that allowing mixed-sex couples to enter civil partnerships would be abused by friends who wanted to claim extra pension payments. 1.43pm: Here, a little late, is a lunchtime summary. • Nick Clegg and Vince Cable have both said that the government is considering a fresh crackdown on the payment of excessive bonuses to bankers. Clegg told the Today programme that he had this message for the bankers. \"If you abuse the generosity of taxpayers, who have provided both directly and indirectly a massive infusion of public funds to bail you out, by awarding yourselves bonuses which will appear as almost gratuitously offensive, then clearly this government won't be able to stand idly by.\" Cable, the business secretary, told the BBC that the government was considering \"potentially quite tough sanctions in terms of tax policy\". (See 8.44am.) • Simon Hughes, the Lib Dems' deputy leader, told the conference that he was \"rock-solid\" supporter of the coalition. Hughes is not a member of the government and he has expressed unease in the past about aspects of coalition policy. But today he said that he expected the coaltion to last five years. He also praised Nick Clegg. (See 12.47pm.) • Hughes criticised the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. In his speech, Hughes said Berlusconi had \"shamefully legislated to protect himself from the proper workings of justice\". (See 12.47pm) • Clegg has said that he will tell other countries to \"step up to the plate\" when he attends the UN conference on the millennium development goals in New York. \"I want to talk to other world leaders and say: look, you've got to step up to the plate as well,\" he said in comments reported by the Press Association. \"There is a lot of backsliding going on. I do not think Britain should be holier-than-thou about this but I do think we need to say 'look, even though we have a lot of problems at home, the long-term challenge of creating a world where you do not have these grotesque inequalities of wealth, it's in our own interests to help those countries'.\" (Did you notice that reference to \"other world leaders\"? That suggests that Clegg is saying he is one himself.) • The Lib Dems asserted their independence by passing three motions relating to localism and social justice. They called for gay couples to be allowed to marry, for welfare cuts to target \"the most affluent\" and for councils to eventually be allowed to raise 75% of their revenue locally. These motions may only have a limited impact on coalition policy, but they will reassure delegates that the party is still retaining its independence. In the debate on fairness, some delegates criticised George Osborne's economic policies, with one describing him as being like \"the reaper of death\". (See 10.10am, 11.14am, 11.39am, 11.50am and 1.03pm) 2.31pm: Nick Clegg has said that some of the delegates who voted against free schools yesterday \"misunderstood\" the government's policy. He made the comments in an interview with Channel 4 News which has just been sent out. As I tried to explain in my speech yesterday, some of the misgivings expressed in the conference hall I genuinely think slightly misunderstand what the government policy is going to do. I think there is a misunderstanding bluntly between what the free schools proposal is alleged to be trying to do and what it will actually do. It won't be taking resources and people and attention away from other schools ... and crucially, as I stressed in my speech yesterday, it won't do what would be genuinely divisive. It won't be introducing selection through the back door, which I'm staunchly opposed to. 2.50pm: There's a technical problem in Liverpool - the internet is down. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible. 3.13pm: I'm back up now. Sorry for the delay. In my roundup of Simon Hughes's speech, I missed the line where he said the Lib Dems should use all their influence in the coalition government, \"sometimes to put on pressure, sometimes to warn and often to encourge\". Last night Hughes said more explicitly that the Lib Dems should be willing to vote against government proposals they object to. He made the comments at a fringe meeting. I was not there, but the World at One played a recording. The truth of the matter is, if all the non-ministerial members of parliament in our party in the Commons, let alone colleagues in the Lords, were determined to say \"up with this we will not put\", then that would effectively mean there would be a block on that legislation. We mustn't be afraid sometimes. 3.29pm: Paul Burstow, the Lib Dem health minister, has just launched an astonishing attack on the Guardian from the conference platform. He was responding to a question about Andrew Lansley's plan for NHS reform. A delegate wanted to know why the Lib Dems were supporting it when it was not in the coalition agreement. This is what Burstow said: I would encourage people to ... stop reading the Guardian, because the Guardian is a spreader of misinformation and lies ... We as a party advocated greater choice and control in public services ... Do not be misled by editors of the Guardian who have not read the white paper [on NHS reform], who have not the coalition programme for government, who have not read our manifesto. Do not believe them. Look at the documents yourself. I think you will see we are delivering liberal ideas. I'm not sure what article upset him so much, but I will try to find out. 3.30pm: It's bash the Guardian day at the Lib Dem conference. Andrew Stunell, the local government minister (who was taking part in a Q&amp;A session with Burstow and two other ministers) had a go at us too. Stunell was defending the decision to abolish the Audit Commission. The Guardianesque theory that this means local authorities will be able to appoint soft auditors - there's no evidence whatsoever that the two thirds of local authorities which are audited by the private sector are sloppier or get away with murder more than those which are audited by the Audit Commission. 3.56pm: Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, has just delivered his conference speech. Here are the key points. • He urged delegates to accept that the government was now committed to nuclear power. He said: The coalition agreement, of course, involves give and take. I expect George Osborne to take more millions of the low-paid out of income tax even though he is a Conservative minister implementing a Liberal Democrat pledge. And George Osborne expects me to deliver our agreement on nuclear power, which is that there is an important place for new nuclear stations in our energy mix as long as there is no public subsidy. • He said he was prepared to intervene to ensure that energy companies are no longer allowed to wait 65 days before telling their customers about price increases. (See 10.34am.) • He said he would insist on energy bills giving customers more information about the best deals on offer from rival companies. \"Giving consumers this information will mean competition forces unfair prices down,\" he said. • He said that at the next election the Lib Dems should make a virtue of the fact that they are willing to work with other parties. We must show – and tell and convince – the country why we, the Liberal Democrats, not the coalition, deserve more votes, more seats, and above all, more power. Because if you like partnership politics, this is the party to support. We are the party that believes in working with others to unite the country. 4.45pm: Here's an afternoon reading list: • Jon Snow on his Channel 4 blog writes about an encounter with Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam González Durántez: Hard to gauge across the Hispanic cultural divide whether she has a droll sense of humour, or a combative countenance. It could be either on show when I suggest that, for a career international lawyer, she must at least have felt safe in the assumption that in marrying a UK Liberal Democrat he would never become deputy prime minister. I dig deeper, suggesting that – now that he had – it must be a bit of a shock to the system. \"Rubbish\", she says. \"I always expected him to go to the top. I'm not remotely surprised that he has become deputy prime minister.\" \"In fact,\" she adds, \"I always expected him to become PRIME Minister – and I still do!\" \"You are a patronising man,\" she quips. I respond: \"And you are a true romantic!\" We agree to settle for a score draw. A formidable and attractive force she is. • The Daily Telegraph publishes its list of the 25 most influential Liberal Democrats. • Cathy Newman on her Channel 4 FactCheck blog says Nick Clegg was wrong to say that child poverty went up under Labour. • Susan Kramer is narrowly ahead of Tim Farron in the race to be the next Lib Dem president, according to a poll conducted by Lib Dem Voice. 5.01pm: My colleague James Randerson, one of the Guardian's environment experts, has given his verdict on Chris Huhne's speech. He says Huhne's promise to make the government \"the greenest ever\" may come back to haunt him. 5.02pm: Major welfare reform may not happen until 2014, Steve Webb, the welfare minister, told the conference earlier. The BBC's live blog has picked up this quote from the Q&amp;A session earlier: I think the big reform of dynamic benefits and so on could be up to four years away. 5.18pm: Many Lib Dems do not know what party policy is, Andrew Stunell told the conference earlier. The local government minister said he was often criticised by members because the coalition was implementing policies that the party supported. One of the things I've discovered since we did the coalition agreement is that the majority of Liberal Democrats had no idea what Liberal Democrat policy was. I mean I fielded a lot of criticism for things that are in the coalition agreement that I fought to get in it because it's Liberal Democrat policy ... I do think that people think 'Why have you done that, why have you done this?' - I mean, cutting red tape. I fought how many elections on cutting red tape... [yet] the moment we don't proceed with a regulation which hasn't even come into force yet, I get bombarded by Liberal Democrats saying: 'What on earth are you doing?' I'm following Liberal Democrat policy, friends. 5.24pm: Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, has issued this statement about Chris Huhne's speech: Chris Huhne has let down those who believed the coalition's pledge to be the greenest government ever. No money for the green investment bank, no upgrade of the ports that are so vital for our offshore wind industry, no commitment to clean energy cashback for electricity or heat. And no plan to tackle fuel poverty. 5.50pm: I'm about to wrap up. First, here's an afternoon summary: • Chris Huhne has told the Lib Dems that being in coalition could win them votes. In a speech, he said that they should view sharing power with another party as an electoral asset, not a liability. \"Because if you like partnership politics, this is the party to support,\" he said. \"We are the party that believes in working with others to unite the country.\" • Huhne has said that he is committed to nuclear energy and renewable energy. The energy secretary told the conference: \"I am fed up with the stand-off between renewable and nuclear which means we have neither – we will have both.\" (See 3.56pm and 5.01pm) • Nick Clegg has said that some of the delegates who voted against academies and free schools yesterday may have \"misunderstood\" the government's policy. The Lib Dem leader told Channel 4 News: \"There is a misunderstanding bluntly between what the free schools proposal is alleged to be trying to do and what it will actually do.\" (See 2.31pm) • Being nice to the Sun and slagging off the Guardian – the Lib Dems have shown that they now really are a party of government by adopting a media strategy familiar to students of New Labour. In his speech this morning, Simon Hughes referred to the fact that the Sun has sent its political editor to the conference for the first time. \"We know who you are. You are particularly welcome,\" he said. This afternoon Paul Burstow, a health minister, said: \"The Guardian is a spreader of misinformation and lies.\" (I called Burstow to find out more about his grievance, but he has not been back to me.) (See 3.29pm). That's it for today.

Hours can be lost skydiving your way towards your favourite locations. Seeing somewhere you know so well from above provides valuable extra servings of knowledge and perspective. It's pleasing, therefore, to see Google announcing on its official blog that it has developed some nifty new features to coincide with the Copenhagen climate conference, now only a matter of weeks away. In collaboration with the Danish government and others, we are launching a series of Google Earth layers and tours to allow you to explore the potential impacts of climate change on our planet and the solutions for managing it. Working with data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we show on Google Earth the range of expected temperature and precipitation changes under different global emissions scenarios that could occur throughout the century. To help introduce us all to these features, Google has asked Al Gore – who acts as a \"senior advisor\" to the company – to provide the commentary on an accompanying video. The search engine has also teamed up with CNN to establish a dedicated YouTube channel. Entitled \"Raise Your Voice\", it features a series of videos by world leaders and well-known faces (Emma Thompson and the crown prince of Denmark, to date) to help explain why the conference is so important. Submissions from the public are welcome, and the best will be aired during the conference in the meeting rooms and on CNN. I've had a quick play around with the new Google Earth features – they allow you to \"view\" any location on earth up till the year 2100, according to both the IPCC's high and low emissions scenarios. You may be asked to install a plugin, as I was. Google promises more features in coming weeks. By the looks of Al Gore's video, we can expect additional versions allowing us to see predicted sea-level rises, water depletion and polar ice-sheet melting. Extra tours are promised that will help us \"learn about the range of available solutions\". According to Gore, \"you will visualise a new world of renewable energy, and see what individuals and communities around the world are doing to both reduce their carbon footprint and adapt to their changing climates\". If Google can keep on adding tools and features, this could develop into something truly useful – particularly for schools. And it would be nice, too, if the crowd-sourcing potential of Google Maps could somehow be exploited by users. What additional layers of information would you like to see? Predicted impacts on habitats? Likely spread of malaria endemic areas? Data showing variations in public attitudes to the threat of climate change? Regional increases (and decreases) in human population? The location of existing and planned nuclear power stations? Over to you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/nov/29/iran-international-atomic-energy-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-29T16:10:00Z","webTitle":"Iran approves 10 new nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/iran-international-atomic-energy-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/nov/29/iran-international-atomic-energy-agency","fields":{"headline":"Iran approves 10 new nuclear plants","bodyText":"The Iranian government has approved the construction of 10 new uranium enrichment plants, according to state TV, in a further escalation in the diplomatic battle over the country's nuclear capability. The Iranian nuclear agency has been told by the government to begin work on five new sites, with locations for a further five to be found in the next two months, the report said. The decision was reportedly made during a cabinet meeting headed by the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, this evening. It comes shortly after Iran warned it may cut back already limited co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after being censured by the UN watchdog for concealing the existence of a nuclear enrichment plant. MPs in Tehran today called on Ahmadinejad to reconsider his policy towards the IAEA after Friday's resolution insisting that Iran resume negotiations. It was the first time in nearly four years that Tehran had faced censure by all five permanent members of the UN security council – their rare unanimity reflecting deepening international exasperation over the impasse in nuclear talks. Ali Larijani, the powerful speaker of the majlis (parliament), said: \"If you do not abandon the ridiculous carrot-and-stick policy, we will take a new approach towards you.\" The parliament also announced it was allocating $20m (£12.1m) to back unnamed \"progressive\" groups to combat US and British \"conspiracies\". The majlis is dominated by hardliners who maintain pressure on the government to remain defiant despite talk of sanctions being imposed within weeks if nuclear negotiations do not make progress. \"Because of world powers' behaviour, the government should submit its plan over reducing the level of Iran's co-operation with the agency,\" MPs said in a statement. Parliament can oblige the government to decrease co-operation as it did in 2006, after the Vienna-based agency voted to report Iran to the UN security council. Western diplomats believe, however, that Iran will not burn its bridges with the IAEA for fear of alienating other countries who defend it on the grounds of its legal rights and western double standards. Iran's formal position is that it is seeking nuclear power for electricity generation, as it is entitled to as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But it has failed to dispel suspicions that it is seeking secretly to build a nuclear bomb. September's revelation of the existence of a second enrichment plant near Qom fuelled those suspicions. The US has warned that its patience is not unlimited, but doors are being left open in the hope that Iran will somehow re-engage. Underlining the possibility of diplomatic progress, Turkey was reported to be mediating between Iran and the IAEA over a proposal that would see Iran's uranium processed overseas, according to al-Arabiya TV. Turkish-Iranian relations have warmed up in recent months. Still, there is pessimism in western capitals about the prospect for a breakthrough because of the way the nuclear issue has become enmeshed in Iran's turbulent domestic politics. Mehi Karroubi, one of the defeated reformist candidates in June's disputed presidential elections, attacked Ahmadinejad at the weekend for his \"adventurist\" nuclear policy. Karroubi and Mirhossein Mousavi, who says he beat the hardline incumbent, say they plan to keep on leading protests against the government. Iran's parliament said that the $20m it had authorised would be disbursed by a committee including representatives of the ministries of intelligence, communications, culture and foreign affairs and the Revolutionary Guards, and would be used to target and resist US and British \"conspiracies\". The announcement appears to fit in with a new emphasis on using \"soft power\" to combat Iran's western enemies, which it has repeatedly accused of seeking to foment a \"velvet revolution\" and orchestrating post-election protests in which dozens were killed in clashes with security forces and thousands detained. The money is being drawn from Iran's oil stabilisation fund. Recipients were not identified but there was speculation that the funds might be earmarked for groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinian Islamists of Hamas, which Iran also supports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/oct/06/simpsons-health-obesity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-06T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Simpsons' obesity drive | Neville Rigby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/06/simpsons-health-obesity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/06/simpsons-health-obesity","fields":{"headline":"The Simpsons' obesity drive","bodyText":"In what surely must be seen as a triumph of hope over experience, the government's official obesity campaign is turning to cartoon capers in a move to persuade everyone – if they haven't realised already – that we should do more to get the kids to take up healthier eating and exercise. In these harrowing financial times where almost everything else is being cut back, the Department of Health has decided it's worthwhile forking out £640,000 from its Change4Life kitty to sponsor The Simpsons. Gillian Merron, the public health minister, feels Homer and co provide a \"popular and engaging way to get the message to real-life families about simple ways of improving their diet and activity for a healthier lifestyle\". What the Change4Life campaign and its supporters seem to overlook at times is that the complexity of obesity cannot be addressed by delivering media messages that pin the blame on the individual for failing to adopt a \"healthy lifestyle\", no matter how you try to flip the message into a positive one. Obesity is symptomatic of some fundamental and structural changes in society that have gone on over many decades and have had a quite marked adverse impact. Inevitably it is easier to promulgate a \"public health announcement\" than to address those multiple causes of obesity, which were laid out in such remarkable detail by government scientists in their expansive Foresight report. Anyone who has ever watched The Simpsons (and it seems it is assumed that we all do) will probably realise that The Simpsons is now what The Archers used to be – a medium in which not so subliminal messages on contemporary issues are often embedded for a mass audience. It's not a new idea. In fact when it comes to obesity Homer has been there and done that. Back in the mid-90s one of most popular episodes of The Simpsons ever involved the hapless Homer gorging himself in order to become obese (that should be even more obese) in order to evade an obligatory employees' health and exercise campaign in the nuclear power plant where he worked, and to obtain a disability dispensation to work from home. Woven into the plot were stark messages – warnings from Marge and Lisa that he was seriously endangering his health. The \"King-size Homer\" was even shown succumbing to ill-health due to his weight, and being a victim of the all too familiar discrimination suffered by obese people. There are no statistics to show how many viewers in the US were motivated to tackle their weight after watching the programme. In fact obesity rates have probably risen by 50% in the years since the programme first went out. So what is the take home message? I well remember being addicted as a child to one of the most popular children's cartoons of all time. It contained frequent episodes of violence, depicted women – well, one in particular – as sex objects and rammed home a health message embedded in every episode. I don't think Popeye had any more success in promoting spinach sales than Homer achieved in the US in preventing obesity. But Homer's dumb expression will take on a new meaning from now on – DoH!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2009/nov/04/council-climate-change-resolutions","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-04T18:15:00Z","webTitle":"Council climate change resolutions are just a lot of hot air | Charles Arthur","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/04/council-climate-change-resolutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/nov/04/council-climate-change-resolutions","fields":{"headline":"Council climate change resolutions are just a lot of hot air","bodyText":"We've got the builders in. Yes, we're doing building. And doing building means building inspectors, sent by the council to make sure we aren't building a fire trap in the extension to our house. They're also very keen to check we're not building something that won't conform to new environmental regulations: the ceiling and walls have to have particular thicknesses of insulating material, which doesn't come cheap, but will – we're assured – save energy. Though when the inspector called a few days ago, he regretfully had to point out that we needed to add another 4cm of insulation to the sloping ceiling that we'd hoped would house a bedroom and perhaps even a toilet. With the extra insulation, it's starting to look as though we're only going to be inviting very small children to the bedroom. And for our builder, the extra 4cm was a layer too far. \"But you've got us putting that in while you've also insisted that we have single-glazed windows all through!\" he blurted, his indignation finally getting the better of him. It's true. Our local council, which recently passed a solemn resolution that it was against climate change and would take it \"seriously\", has insisted that we may not have double-glazed windows in the new building. Why? Because the main building is, by virtue of its age, listed – that strange process by which slightly obsessive-compulsive types hope to hang on to the past by pretending that the present isn't happening and that the future won't mind. Ah, but it gets better. The main building – the one in which we actually, you know, live – isn't a paragon of \"listedness\" (unless you mean actually physically listing, which the floors do towards one end). In fact, it has a number of double-glazed windows. And who put them in? Why, the council itself, which used to own the property a few decades ago. Shall we recap? We're building a modern extension in which we're obliged to put energy-leaking windows in order to conform to an historic ideal about our main home that hasn't actually been followed by the organisation now forcing us to put in the inefficient windows. The whole process is indicative of how utterly our establishment has failed to get to grips with the twin realities of climate change and energy demand, which aren't linked but have similar outcomes: we need to use less fossil fuel energy. (Yes, we could use secondary glazing on the windows, but it's far less effective than real double glazing.) For years, the Labour government has shied away from making rational – if politically brave – decisions about energy use: we've needed more investment in nuclear power and renewables. Instead, six years ago nuclear was left out of the energy white paper. That's six years of not building the replacement for fossil fuels we've used (and will in future have to import from countries such as Russia, not known for its helpfulness towards Britain). I wish someone had noticed what Norway was doing – investing its windfall from oil exports in new energy sources. Too late now for North Sea oil. We spent it on … well, possibly the banks. Meanwhile, our local councils run masterclasses in cognitive dissonance: frowning on climate change, \"urging\" action, insisting its aim is to \"reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the council and the district\", while forcing people to do things that will be costly in precisely those terms in the future. My guess is that a sensible government in the future would drop the whole idea of \"listing\" buildings. The trouble is that when the energy crunch comes, it will be too late. We'll have been driven down a road wearing the blinkers imposed by the past. Stupidity comes in many forms; and on this occasion, it comes in the form of insulation standing by a single-glazed window."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/sep/25/iran-admits-uranium-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-25T09:26:40Z","webTitle":"Iran admits secret uranium enrichment plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/25/iran-admits-uranium-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/sep/25/iran-admits-uranium-plant","fields":{"headline":"Iran admits secret uranium enrichment plant","bodyText":"Iran has admitted the existence of a secret uranium plant revealed by US officials this morning, bringing the long crisis over the country's nuclear programme to a head. Iran sent a letter to Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on Monday, saying it had established a second pilot uranium enrichment plant, parallel to the one monitored by the IAEA in Natanz. According to western officials, the letter was only sent after the Iranian government discovered the secret plant had been discovered by western intelligence. Barack Obama, flanked by Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is expected to deliver an ultimatum to Iran on the fringes of the G20 summit in Pittsburgh later today. The late admission to the IAEA is unlikely to spare Iran from immediate demands from the international community to show IAEA inspectors the secret plant, and to halt all uranium enrichment. The revelation of the second plant's existence now make harsh new UN sanctions much more likely if Iran refuses to stop enriching. According to the New York Times the secret site is built inside a mountain near the ancient city of Qom, one of the holiest Shia cities in the Middle East. The IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog, which has been investigating the Iranian programmes for six years, received a letter on Monday from Tehran, confessing to the establishment of another secret, underground complex south of Tehran for the enrichment of uranium that can be used for power generation and also, when highly enriched, for warheads. The Associated Press reported that diplomats accredited to the IAEA had been shown the letter, in which the Iranians admitted developing the undeclared plant at an undisclosed location south of Tehran. According to Reuters, an Iranian news agency, quoting an \"informed source\", confirmed reports of a second uranium enrichment plant, saying it was similar to Iran's first such plant near Natanz. \"Reports by some foreign news agencies that Iran has launched its second enrichment centre are correct and Iran has informed the [UN nuclear watchdog] about this,\" the ISNA news agency quoted its source as saying. \"The second enrichment centre is similar to the enrichment installations at Natanz,\" the source said. Analysts speculated that the Iranians had delivered a partial confession because they knew that US intelligence was monitoring the activities and they were about to be exposed. The three leaders in Pittsburgh are to demand that the Iranians make the new site accessible to the UN inspectors, the New York Times reported. According to the NYT, US officials have been tracking the covert project for years. Obama decided to go public after Iran discovered that western intelligence agencies had breached the secrecy surrounding the project. According to the newspaper the facility is not complete. American officials said they believe it was designed to hold about 3,000 centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium for nuclear power plants and potentially for bombs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/mar/14/ian-mcewan-environment-novel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-14T00:09:04Z","webTitle":"Ian McEwan's Solar: it's green and it should be read | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/14/ian-mcewan-environment-novel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/14/ian-mcewan-environment-novel","fields":{"headline":"Ian McEwan's Solar: it's green and it should be read","bodyText":"Gossip columnists long ago supplanted the literary editors in media hierarchies, and a writer must be grateful if the press greets the publication of his or her book with anything so quaint as a discussion of its literary merit. When Martin Amis released The Pregnant Widow in February, he discovered that the big issue for journalists was not how he expressed his ideas but whether he had upset Anna Ford. The former newsreader proved she is not at her best when the autocue is off by accusing him of smoking in the hospital room where her husband was dying in 1988 – he didn't, apparently – and of being a neglectful godfather to her daughter, a charge that even if true had nothing to do with his book. After this, Ian McEwan must be grateful that Angela Rippon is not greeting the publication of Solar by announcing that he stood her up on a date in 1976, or that Fiona Bruce is not telling the papers he snubbed her at a dinner party during Blair's first term. The \"story\" about McEwan nevertheless remains as irrelevant to his fiction as the babbling about whether the atheist Amis was a good godfather. Inspired by the Sunday Times, the pack has decided that McEwan is satirising a voyage in which he accompanied Rachel Whiteread, Antony Gormley and other enlightened artists to see the effect of global warming in the Arctic. McEwan does indeed acknowledge his debt to the Cape Farewell expedition, and includes a scene in which the cynical hero contrasts the idealistic conversation of his progressive companions when they are together at dinner with the naked selfishness with which they steal each other's gloves, scarves and helmets in the ship's boot room. \"Four days ago the room had started out in orderly condition, with all gear hanging on or stowed below the numbered pegs,\" says Michael Beard. \"Finite resources, equally shared, in the golden age of not so long ago. Now it was a ruin… How were they to save the Earth when it was so much larger than the boot room?\" As scoops go, however, the hacks' effort was five years late – and so did not even qualify as yesterday's news. When he returned from the Arctic in 2005, McEwan made the contrast between the highmindedness of the dinner table and the low scramble for petty advantage in the boot room in a speech you can still find on the internet. More pertinently, he understands that the contradiction is at the heart of contemporary environmental concerns. Far from mocking fears about climate change, McEwan is struggling to find a way to write them. Opposition to global warming has been a good cause which has failed to inspire good fiction. I do not claim encyclopaedic knowledge, but Solar is the first novel I have read to tackle it successfully. The difficulty was that there appeared to be no space for any emotion except despair. If Europe slashed its carbon emissions, would America reciprocate? Even if it did, how could you persuade one billion Chinese consumers not to buy cars or hundreds of millions of Indians and Africans to abandon self-enrichment? The campaign against climate change ran against the grain of human nature. McEwan has found a way out by turning to the pioneering green thinkers James Lovelock and Stewart Brand, who have been begging environmentalists to stand their old opposition to technology on its head. They want them to see nuclear power, mega-cities and GM food as innovations that can slow down emissions. To put it another way, they hope to use 21st-century science to limit the damage caused by 19th and 20th-century science. McEwan tells me that he prefers technicians to humanities graduates who spout apocalyptic predictions. He sniffs in some the same fanaticism that inspired millenarian religion, communism and fascism, and suspects they want to compensate for the knowledge of the inevitability of their own deaths by imagining that the species will go down with them. The optimism – and it may be a false optimism – new technologies bring allows McEwan to create a protagonist who is not an impossibly righteous hero or the gritty survivor of a coming catastrophe but an all too fleshy adulterer and glutton. Michael Beard is a Nobel Laureate whose glory days are long gone. He steals the work of an equally lecherous colleague, who dies, appropriately, by slipping on a polar bear-skin rug. Beard realises the robbed research could create a new source of clean energy and goes on a slob's progress through the arguments against global warming as he tries to cash in. When his American business partner wonders if the denialists of the Tea Party movement may be right, Beard delivers a devastating account of the arguments for manmade global warming, which ends with the unanswerable point that in the unlikely event of the vast majority of qualified scientists being wrong, we'll be hitting peak oil soon and will need alternative energy anyway. He neatly illuminates the link between Palinism and postmodernism by forcing Beard to endure an audience at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts, which bellows that his so-called science is nothing but a \"social construct\" designed to preserve the \"hegemonic arrogance\" of the \"white male elite\". My colleagues should note that McEwan shows that the ICA rather than the Cape Farewell project has been the true butt of satirists ever since Amis invited its relativist crowd to raise their hands if they thought they were morally superior to the Taliban and only one third did. (\"So many?\" I hear you gasp. Yes, I was surprised too.) The novel's burning question comes when Beard asks an audience of City investors, \"How can we slow down and stop while sustaining our civilisation and continuing to bring millions out of poverty? Not by being virtuous… For humanity en masse, greed trumps virtue. So we have to welcome into our solutions the ordinary compulsions of self-interest, and also celebrate novelty, the thrill of invention [and] the pleasures of ingenuity.\" McEwan attempts the difficult trick of blending raucous comedy with science and politics. I think he pulls it off magnificently. But given the current state of British criticism, I accept that you may want to hear what the newsreaders have to say before deciding for yourselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/12/ecotowns-green-revolution-climate-change-gordon-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-11T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Britain's green revolution will power economic recovery | Gordon Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/12/ecotowns-green-revolution-climate-change-gordon-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/12/ecotowns-green-revolution-climate-change-gordon-brown","fields":{"headline":"Britain's green revolution will power economic recovery","bodyText":"Two centuries ago, Britain was at the forefront of a new industrial age that transformed our small island into the workshop of the world and a global economic powerhouse. Now we must once more harness the expertise of our engineers and scientists - and the ambition of our entrepreneurs - to embrace a green revolution that will significantly change the way we all live and work. At a historic summit in Italy last week, G8 leaders agreed to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels and cut their emissions by 80% by 2050. I know that, for many people, these summits can feel like grand talking shops with abstract arguments about issues of little relevance to their daily lives. But climate change will affect every individual, every family, every community, every business, every economy and every government. And I am determined that Britain will be at the forefront of the transition to low-carbon societies. Not only because it is our moral duty to future generations and because climate change, caused largely by the richest nations, hits the poorest and most vulnerable hardest. But because this new approach will underpin our push towards economic recovery - providing new growth, new jobs, new industries and new opportunities. The global environmental sector will be worth £4.3 trillion by 2015 and sustain tens of millions of jobs. So the countries and companies that develop the technologies and services fastest will, as with the industrial revolution, reap the richest rewards. We already lead the world in many environmental technologies, from offshore wind to environmental instrumentation, and from energy control systems to carbon markets. Within a decade, 1.2 million people in the UK will be employed in the green sector as a result of the investment decisions we are taking. Factories producing energy-saving products, construction companies erecting renewable energy systems, scientists working to develop new nuclear power, mechanics maintaining hybrid engines and people installing insulation in homes: this is the workforce of the future. So as we meet our international obligations, we must seize the opportunity for a comprehensive transition to a greener, cleaner future for Britain - one which is fairer, stronger and more prosperous for all. Two weeks ago, the government launched Building Britain's Future, setting out our radical plan for recovery and beyond into a digital, low-carbon, high-technology age. We will pursue a new, more active industrial policy - investing towards a nationwide high-speed broadband network by 2016, building a world-class modern infrastructure and supporting future industries such as biotechnology, life sciences, advanced manufacturing and financial services. And over the coming fortnight we will push further ahead with a series of announcements on electric cars and railways and on energy-efficient homes and communities. Ed Miliband will this week set out how we will meet our legally binding commitment to cut UK emissions by a third by 2020 and Peter Mandelson will unveil our low-carbon industrial strategy. This will involve innovative schemes, such as loans to families to make energy-efficiency improvements that are repaid though savings on fuel bills, and cashback schemes for households and communities that generate their own clean energy. Under the Great British Refurb we aim to have every loft and cavity wall in the country insulated by 2015 and smart meters in every home by 2020. The revolutionary concept of ecotowns, meanwhile, gives us the opportunity to provide desperately needed affordable homes in environmentally friendly communities. This week, John Healey will be announcing the shortlist of locations. A reformed planning system will speed up decisions on applications for the national infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants, wind farms and sea ports. The UK is leading the world in backing the construction of up to four commercial power plants with carbon capture and storage. The North Sea will once again become the powerhouse of Europe's energy production - this time through offshore wind farms rather than oil wells. And this week we will open south-east England's largest on-shore wind farm and set out how innovative wave and tidal schemes will help us to generate 15% of our energy needs from renewable sources by 2020. Some of the measures we will undertake are undeniably controversial. Some argue that, amid demanding economic conditions, our resolve to meet environmental commitments should weaken. The opposite is true. Over the next 30 years, we face warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers, accompanied by rising sea levels, inland flooding, drought and heat waves. Climate change projections issued last month suggested that, if we don't act urgently to cut emissions, these will become even more severe. The science says we have to take radical action, the economics says we should, and morally we must. Just as the Victorians made Britain the first industrialised nation and reaped the rewards, so we can harvest the benefits of being among the first major developed countries to convert to a green economy. The transition is not something to be delayed because of the global recession; instead it is the driver of our recovery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jan/19/obama-emissions-congress-murkowski","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-19T14:30:10Z","webTitle":"Obama faces emissions U-turn with new Congress challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/19/obama-emissions-congress-murkowski","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jan/19/obama-emissions-congress-murkowski","fields":{"headline":"Obama faces emissions U-turn with new Congress challenge","bodyText":"The Obama administration faces a challenge in Congress that could strip it of its powers to cut greenhouse gas emissions, barely a month after committing to action at the Copenhagen climate change summit. An Alaska Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, is expected to put forward a proposal for a vote as early as tomorrow that would seek to prevent the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. A show of support for Murkowski's proposal would be a personal humiliation for Obama who told the Copenhagen summit that America was committed to action on climate change. It also threatens to remove a fall-back position if Congress fails to pass a climate change law. Climate law has stalled in the Senate and Democratic leaders had sought to use the possibility of EPA regulation as a prod to get Senate to start moving again. Democrats admit the underlying message of Murkowski's proposed vote – that action on climate is bad – could completely kill off its chances. \"It's a highly political move, and a highly hazardous one to our health and the environment,\" said Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at a conference in New York. \"If this senator succeeds, it could keep Congress from working constructively in a bipartisan manner to pass clean energy legislation this year.\" Thirty-seven environmental and health organisations have condemned Murkowski's effort to block the EPA. The senator has also been widely criticised for calling on energy industry lobbyists to help draft her proposals. But Robert Dillon, a spokesman for Murkowski, argued she was trying to stop Democrats from using the stick of EPA regulation to force through flawed measures. \"What this vote means is that you can't use this to blackmail Congress to pass bad legislation. The whole approach has been the administration threatening Congress that if you don't pass bad legislation, we are going to pass worse regulation,\" he said. The EPA ruled in December that greenhouse gas emissions are a danger the public. The finding compels the EPA to begin curbing emissions from power plants and – though widely acknowledged as an option of last resort – was seen as an important \"Plan B\" should climate legislation fail in Congress. Unlike many of her fellow Republicans – and some Democrats from midwestern states – Murkowski has tried to position herself as a potential supporter of action on climate change. Although she comes from a state whose fortunes depend on oil, she has acknowledged the effects of global warming. But she has voted against climate change bills in the past, and is opposed to the proposals that are currently in circulation. \"She supports doing something to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions but the prerequisite is that it must not harm the economy and it must lead to substantial reductions,\" Dillon said. \"The bill we have seen so far does none of that.\" Dillon said Murkowski was still weighing her options on which measures to use to try to block the EPA. She could seek an amendment to an unrelated bill on debt due to go to a vote on 20 January, or she could introduce a resolution of disapproval, which would not be subject to a filibuster and would need only 51 votes to pass. He said Murkowski already had the support of 34 Republicans, and was reaching out to Democrats. Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, said other senators who support climate change law but are opposed to EPA regulation could be tempted to vote for the Murkowski proposal. \"The vote on the Murkowski bill is not going to be a surrogate for a vote on climate,\" he said. \"But it is a very serious challenge to the nation's ability to go forward if there isn't legislation.\" He did not expect Murkowski's proposal to pass. Even if did pass it would still need to go through the house and leap the unlikely hurdle of being signed into law by Obama. But environmentalists fear the symbolism of a vote against action on greenhouse gas emissions would turn already wary Democrats from oil and gas states away from climate change law. It would also send a damaging signal to the international community just as countries are trying to move ahead on fleshing out the 12-paragraph accord on global warming produced at the Copenhagen summit, said campaigners. \"How can Congress contemplate sending a signal to the world that we are not serious about holding big polluters accountable under the Clean Air Act for climate pollution when other nations have finally stepped forward together to try to tackle this problem?\" said Jeremy Symons of the National Wildlife Federation. A troika of Senators – the Democrat John Kerry, Republican Lindsey Graham and Independent Joe Lieberman – are working on climate change proposals aimed at gathering broad support from Republicans as well as Democrats – in part by expanding the role of nuclear power and compromising on offshore oil and gas drilling. But the senators have yet to make public their proposal – let alone draft a bill. The delay is causing increasing concern among supporters of climate change action, especially with the approach of congressional elections next November when the Democrats anticipate losses that could weaken their hold on Congress."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/finance-round-table-report-07jul10","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-07T16:41:05Z","webTitle":"Funds for a greener future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/finance-round-table-report-07jul10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/finance-round-table-report-07jul10","fields":{"headline":"Funds for a greener future","bodyText":"Climate change was a problem before the recession and it will still be a problem after the financial crisis eases. Economies still need to be weaned off dwindling supplies of oil and gas, and the transition to the much-vaunted low-carbon economy remains just as daunting. Where will the money come from to drive such a change? Governments were willing, if not happy, to pour billions into discredited banks, so where is the finance to tackle what the same governments regularly label one of the biggest threats to our way of life? And if the so-called green economy offers a myriad of get-rich opportunities, why do so many remain reluctant to invest? On the eve of the recent budget, a roundtable meeting, organised by PricewaterhouseCoopers and hosted by the Guardian, gathered to discuss these and other questions. How, the experts wanted to know, can money flow from investors to green technology? What should the government's green investment bank or fund look like? What is needed from government policy on regulation, taxes and incentives? And how can carbon pricing and schemes such as the feed-in tariff, which pays a premium for green electricity, be used to bolster the faltering market in carbon credits? To encourage frank discussion, the event was held under the Chatham House rule, which allows comments to be reported without attribution. Despite the recent publication of a government-commissioned report, which set out ideas for the structure of a green investment bank, the government has yet to confirm what exact shape this structure will take. The roundtable discussion remains therefore highly pertinent, particularly the warning from one attendee that delays would be costly. Time is money, after all. \"The main risk is that we spend too long talking about what the bank is and what it should do, and that that delay chills the investment flow,\" one participant said. The Treasury is key, and officials there remain naturally hostile to green initiatives, one expert suggested. \"It will take the most senior politicians in the country to say: 'We're going to do this', otherwise we will still be talking about a green investment bank in a year's time.\" Almost all features of the bank and the way it will operate are yet to be decided. The bank could potentially bridge the gap between early-stage clean-technology venture capitalists and developers, though some fear that it could crowd out private sector finance and cancel out the promised benefits. \"The main market failure for the bank to address is not that investment doesn't happen, but that there is a scale and a speed problem,\" one participant said. How much money would the bank need from the public purse? Perhaps £2bn-£3bn initially, one expert predicted, which could be raised through a levy on banks. \"That could be leveraged up through the bond market, until there was, say, £20bn on the balance sheet.\" And how would the money be spent? \"It could go through, project by project, helping each over the early hump. Then the equity could be recycled, through investors issuing bonds that are long-dated and underpinned.\" There was some disagreement about whether such bonds would need to be guaranteed by the government to attract investment. Such a guarantee would mean lower returns for investors, one expert argued. Another said: \"There is no such thing as green investment. There is only investment. If a project isn't going to make a profit, then you're just giving grants to people.\" There was also concern that the act to create the bank could be viewed by politicians as sufficient. \"There is a danger of them viewing it as ticking a box. There is a technical job that needs to be done to de-risk investment, but there has to be a risk of political grandstanding and that it will be seen as the solution to the problem.\" An argument was made that the creation of the bank might distract from essential policy change. \"It could be a total distraction and mean that the government will lose focus on initiatives such as reforming the electricity market and introducing the electric car. The green investment bank doesn't have a job to do without the correct public policy in place.\" But what about those who we want to provide the money? \"We need a green investment bank because the policy details are so complicated. You can't expect a bunch of pension fund managers to invest the time,\" one attendee said. \"Project finance is an old dog that we are trying to get to do new tricks,\" another added. There was wide agreement that the green investment bank alone would have little impact. \"Ultimately, the risk comes from the public policy side. We simply can't do this unless the different [government] departments cooperate.\" Another key issue discussed at the roundtable, and dodged by the chancellor in the budget, was the suggestion that a floor should be placed on the price of carbon. The value of these carbon credits, key to the reduction of greenhouse gases through emissions trading, has always been volatile, but has seen sharp falls in the wake of the recession. Under one floor-price model, if the trading price of carbon fell below the chosen floor price, companies buying credits would need to make up the difference through a payment to the government. This would amount to a carbon tax by another name, one attendee claimed. \"A floor price would have a profound effect on where we would put our money,\" another said. The UK plans would affect the UK only, which could be problematic in a Europe-wide emissions trading scheme. \"Can we hit our profit-making companies at a time of recession?\" asked one attendee. \"We need to do this at a European level.\" Some attendees expressed fears that the floor price policy is a thinly-veiled attempt to make nuclear power more economically competitive and so encourage companies to build new atomic power stations in Britain. One problem with the floor price idea is that the floor is likely to be set way above the current market price for the permits. \"It's complicated stuff, but we do have to have a floor because the volatile price of carbon doesn't help the financing of projects,\" one expert said. \"There is a timing mismatch between the investment and lifespan of an asset and the certainty provided by government policy,\" another added. \"It seems a very parochial solution to a problem caused by a failure to solve the root cause: the lack of an international agreement,\" one participant said. It would be better to raise the carbon price across Europe by convincing the European Commission to increase the continent's carbon target for 2020, from 20% cuts to 30% cuts, several attendees agreed. Only Italy is believed now to oppose such a shift. A unilateral carbon price floor in Britain would at least keep the money in the UK, rather than see it all used to buy cheap credits from overseas, one expert pointed out. On other issues, participants thought that some use of public-private finance mechanisms was required. \"There is no magic to this, you just have to find ways of combining public and private finance,\" one said. \"Though I long for something not as complicated [as existing private finance initiative agreements].\" One problem, it was pointed out, is that there are variables in UK climate and energy policy, such as planning, market regulation and interventions such as the feed-in tariff, which are beyond the control of investors but would significantly impact their profits. \"To work for investors, you need to know what impact you are going to have in each of these sectors,\" one participant said. \"Investment-grade policy has to be part of the whole energy supply market. You have to understand, with a degree of precision, what you are doing with each of these moving parts.\" Such a lack of joined-up policy in Britain could point to an \"elephant in the room\", it was argued. \"Is there a question that we are neglecting to ask? Does the government truly believe there is a credible threat from climate change?\" one attendee asked. \"There ought to be a statutory limit on how long they can wait after announcing something before they have to do it.\" Others were more sanguine. \"There is not a binary switch,\" said one. \"We do have time to do this. The political debate has been mismanaged, but there remains a clear and pressing need for long-term finance to restructure economies in order to wean them off fossil fuels. Climate change justifies that, but it is not the only reason.\" And will such a change take place? Will the finance be there to make it happen? \"I wouldn't be pessimistic but it would be naive to be optimistic,\" one participant concluded. \"There is still a lot to play out.\" Who took part: Robert Bahns, director of investments, Imperial Innovations James Cameron, vice chair, Climate Change Capital John Godfrey, director of communications, Legal &amp; General Peter Gutman, global head of renewable energy, Standard Chartered Kirsty Hamilton, associate fellow, Energy, Environment and Development Programme, Chatham House Leo Johnson, partner, Pricewaterhouse-Coopers Mark Kember, policy director, Climate Group David Kennedy, chief executive, Committee on Climate Change Simon Mills, head of sustainable development, City of London James Stacey, head of sustainable development, Earth Capital Partners Vimal Vallabh, director corporate finance, Pricewaterhouse-Coopers Bryony Worthington, founder, Sandbag Damian Carrington, head of environment, the Guardian (chair) Roundtable report commissioned and controlled by the Guardian.

We must challenge the myths that the lights will go out unless we agree to build new nuclear power stations, that nuclear power will prevent an increase in dependency on imported gas and that nuclear power is necessary to allow us to meet climate-change goals. Even the government does not believe in the existence of a massive generation gap. In its response to the Commons environmental audit committee's report on energy policy, the government has admitted that \"the risk of having unserved electricity demand is unlikely to become substantively higher than today until around 2015. Even then, the amounts of shortfall between demand and supply are likely to be small and could therefore potentially be resolved by some companies voluntarily shifting their electricity consumption from peak to off-peak times in response to price signals.\" In the same response the government also admitted that \"even with facilitating measures, new nuclear build is likely to make only a small contribution to carbon-emission reductions and security of supply by 2020\". That means there will probably be an increase in the use of gas in the interim, whether or not nuclear goes ahead. In any case, most gas is used in heating homes, for which electricity is not a realistic option. It also means that in judging the contribution nuclear power can make to reducing carbon emissions it has to be compared not with technologies deployable today but with those that will be deployable by the 2020s, including carbon capture and storage, tidal power and wave power. We should not be panicked into accepting a technology that poses a continuing risk in terms of weapons proliferation and terrorism, produces a toxic waste for which no management solution is agreed, benefits from hidden subsidies and tends to undermine both the prospects of renewable energy and efforts to increase energy efficiency.

Closer to home, our understanding of nuclear physics lies at the heart of vital healthcare services in diagnosis and treatment of cancers, approaches to protecting the environment, power generation, our ability to deal with nuclear waste ... the list goes on. Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus 100 years ago was the take-off point for so much we have come to rely on. I wonder what he would make of the sorry state of the funding of British nuclear physics today. The academic community of nuclear physicists, together with particle physicists, astronomers, astrophysicists and space scientists, is waiting for the axe to fall on its research funding in an announcement to be made tomorrow. But why should our howls of protest over budget cuts be heard above everyone else in the public sector? The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), which funds our basic research in UK universities, must claw back a longstanding shortfall of about £40m that arose because it failed to convince government in 2007 of the vital importance of research in astronomy, particle and nuclear physics. All this before taking into account the impending cuts foreshadowed in the chancellor's pre-budget announcements. Compared with bailing out the banks or footballers' salaries, this £40m might seem like peanuts; but the situation for whole areas of science is likely to be catastrophic, and physics and astronomy departments will be surveying the damage to their research income. Nuclear physics is particularly vulnerable. Its academic community of nuclear physicists is small by international comparison – Romania spends twice as much on its basic research – but world-leading in terms of impact. Despite gross underfunding over many years, we have continued to make an outstanding contribution to the field. But it is becoming progressively more difficult for British nuclear scientists to remain internationally competitive in their research. The question is not only whether our science is as important and exciting as other areas, but whether its continued funding stands up against the wider needs of society in health, education or defence. A recent report on nuclear physics and engineering, commissioned by Research Councils UK, stresses the need to maintain a healthy nuclear science base in Britain, and makes it clear that nuclear physics has applications across fields such as healthcare, the environment, the nuclear industry and national security. The report states that \"further funding cuts could be terminal, resulting in the loss of an important skill set which would impact the delivery of masters courses\". Many university research groups run and support masters courses that provide graduates with the skills needed for the nuclear, health and radiological sectors and which are underpinned by our basic nuclear physics research. The supply of skilled workers for the nuclear industry is a high priority for the UK since we must, even if we no longer design and build nuclear power stations, be intelligent customers for reactors commissioned from abroad. We must also have the expertise to decommission old reactors and to deal with nuclear waste. A secure route for the training of this much-needed generation of scientists must be agreed by STFC, along with other research councils and stakeholders, and be clearly visible. In medicine, proton and carbon-beam cancer therapy is driven largely by the nuclear physics community. What is likely to suffer in the funding crisis is the UK's involvement at international accelerator research labs such as GSI in Darmstadt, Germany, where a multinational nuclear research project is being built. It is also where carbon-beam therapy for tumours has been pioneered. What must be addressed now is how the academic community of nuclear physicists and the research councils can best work together to ensure the survival of the best science and those areas of expertise that are essential for the nation's future. This will require constructive thinking and new partnerships; simply lobbying to reverse decisions may be counterproductive, given the number of likely \"don't cut my area\" lobby groups. We must therefore start working with all the stakeholders in agreeing a sensible national policy on the academic provision required in healthcare and for nuclear energy sources. Ministers might reflect on how they will explain in the future their failure to support nuclear physics at the level of a couple of Premier League footballers' wages. Rutherford will be turning in his grave."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2009/nov/25/iran-mohsen-makhmalbaf-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-25T19:18:14Z","webTitle":"Iran should face smarter sanctions, says Mohsen Makhmalbaf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/25/iran-mohsen-makhmalbaf-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/nov/25/iran-mohsen-makhmalbaf-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"Iran should face smarter sanctions, says Mohsen Makhmalbaf","bodyText":"Iran's revolutionary guards should be subject to sanctions to force Tehran to curb its nuclear ambitions and respect democracy, the country's leading film-maker and unofficial spokesman for the opposition Green Movement has said. \"If foreign governments deal only with the atomic bomb and forget about democracy and human rights in Iran, they will help dictatorship,\" Mohsen Makhmalbaf told the Guardian. \"If they want peace in the Middle East, they need a democratic government in Iran. Pressure from inside and pressure from outside can change things.\" Makhmalbaf is widely seen as representing Mir Hossein Mousavi, who claimed victory over Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June's bitterly disputed presidential election. His outspoken comments highlight the dilemma for the US and others: how to engage the Iranian regime over the nuclear issue without undermining the opposition, still reeling over the crisis that erupted when the incumbent hardliner confounded expectations by beating Mousavi in an allegedly rigged vote. An Islamic activist under the shah, Makhmalbaf was in prison until shortly before the 1979 revolution. He left Iran in 2005 after Ahmadinejad was elected for his first term. His 2001 film Kandahar was voted one of the best 100 films of all time. At a ceremony in London tonight he was awarded the 2009 Freedom to Create prize to promote global social justice. He announced he was dedicating it to Ayatollah Ali Montazeri, rival of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, and donated his £50,000 prize to help victims of the brutal post-election crackdown. \"People were killed, imprisoned, tortured and raped just for their votes,\" Makhmalbaf said in his acceptance speech. \"Each award I receive gives me an opportunity to echo their voices across the world, asking for democracy for Iran and peace for the world. It is vital that we continue to talk about freedom and democracy for the Iranian people.\" Makhmalbaf called for \"smart\" sanctions targeting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and their extensive business interests – including a communications monopoly – that are often described as constituting a parallel economy. \"The revolutionary guards are terrorists. They are in Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon. They tortured people in Iran. They rape people in prisons. If you explain to the Iranian people that you are sanctioning their enemies, they will support you.\" He said it was important to avoid measures such as blocking petrol imports because ordinary people would be hurt. Makhmalbaf said he did not believe it would be possible for the international community to reach agreement on the nuclear issue as the regime was determined to acquire a bomb. \"You cannot sign an agrement with fascists,\" he said. \"If someone hijacks a plane, do you make an agreement with the hijackers? If they accept a nuclear agrement they will lose support. They need enemies, especially Khamenei.\" But he warned that any military attack, threatened by Israel if diplomacy failed, would be a setback for democracy. Iran's official line is that it wants nuclear power for civilian power generation and has no interest in building weapons. A UN resolution drafted by security council members calls on Tehran to be more open about its nuclear plans after the revelation that it had nearly completed a new uranium enrichment facility in secret. Makhmalbaf, who lives in Paris, said 70% of Iranians supported the Green movement against only 10% for the regime. \"The government can control demonstrations,\" he said, \"but it cannot manage the country's problems.\" He predicted more opposition protests on public holidays after large-scale demonstrations on Qods day in September and this month's anniversary of the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in Tehran. Makhmalbaf's praise for Montazeri – as \"one of the bravest voices in Iran\" – follows the cleric's public apology for the embassy takeover and the long hostage crisis that followed. He has criticised Barack Obama for not responding. In an oblique criticism of the US president's approach to Iran, Makhmalbaf said: \"Obama is like a teenager who has come up with a new idea to change the world. When George Bush was in the White House, we had the [reformist Mohammed] Khatemi as president. Now we have Ahmadinejad, they have Obama. The timing is not right.\" Listen to an audio clip of Ian Black's interview with Mohsen Makhmalbaf"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/apr/11/samantha-cameron-sarah-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-10T23:06:11Z","webTitle":"Are we choosing a prime minister – or a primate? | Carole Cadwalladr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/11/samantha-cameron-sarah-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/11/samantha-cameron-sarah-brown","fields":{"headline":"Are we choosing a prime minister – or a primate?","bodyText":"I sometimes wonder why we go to all the expense and bother of educating women. The GCSEs, the A-levels, the degrees, the years spent attempting to establish a career… and for what? When, as evidenced last week, to play a meaningful part in Britain's democratic process in 2010, the only qualification a woman truly requires is a Level 1 NVQ in applying makeup and a short primer in how to accessorise one's handbag with one's shoes. Because, yes, it has come to this: a century of struggle, a suffragette or two under a horse, the odd hunger strike, 30 years or so of the Sex Discrimination Act – and three weeks before the election the great debate lighting up the tabloids, the broadsheets, the fashion pages and the News at Ten, is the \"war of the wives\". SamCam, David's \"secret weapon\", takes on Sarah Brown, the first lady of Twitter. If you've had the good fortune to miss the coverage, allow me to summarise: Samantha Cameron looks good in trousers; Sarah in skirts. Both women confine themselves to exchanging pleasantries while their aides reveal where they bought their outfits. Yes, I know, it's impossibly exciting. And yet this is where female representation in politics currently stands. Harriet Harman? Theresa May? The most senior women in the Labour and Conservative parties respectively – so where are they exactly? Not in the news bulletins, that's for sure, or in any newspaper. Which raises the question of why anyone would bother spending years slogging away, anonymously, in parliamentary committee meetings and at interminable constituency dinners, when your time could have been far better spent designing handbags and engaging in a spot of light charity work. If only they'd had the foresight to marry the right men. What the election has made plain is a fact already well known to Tana Ramsay, Coleen Rooney and Jane Austen: if you're a woman who wants power, marry a powerful man. The most influential women in British politics are both entirely unelected, not unlike Roza Otunbayeva, the new leader of Kyrgyzstan, only her particular promotion took the form of an armed insurrection. Which, in the circumstances, doesn't seem like such a bad idea. In all honesty, which would you prefer: five minutes in the Houses of Parliament with a Kalashnikov? Or to be trussed up in jeans and heels, as the Conservative female candidates were last week, hustled under the lights of a photographic studio and pictured in the various newspapers beneath the headlines \"Cameron's Cuties\" and \"Dave's Dolls\"? Blair's Babes, Cameron's Cuties – these women aren't politicians in the sense of possessing political power, they're window dressing, just as Samantha Cameron and Sarah Brown, and even Miriam González Durántez adorn their men. All this fluff, this tittle-tattle, this pointless detail about SamCam's wardrobe and SarBro's shoes is an embodiment of the idea that a woman is accoutrement of the man she marries, his trophy, his prize. None of this is politics: the \"war of the wives\", the \"battle of the spouses\", the in-depth reports on News at Ten about \"the SamCam effect\" and the questions at Gordon Brown's news conference on \"the Sarah Brown strategy\". It's evolutionary biology with all the sophistication and subtlety of a troop of chimpanzees sniffing each other's bottoms. How do you establish dominance in a chimp pack? Pant, hoot, scream, rough up your rivals and impregnate the most attractive females you can. Is this what we want, too? To choose our next prime minister on the basis of who has the prettiest wife or of who has most recently managed to get her up the duff? We are higher primates with large frontal lobes capable of complex thought. We can evaluate policies and assess strategies. Or we can carry on the way we are: by judging women on how they look and men on who they mate. David Cameron: the new prime minister-in-chimp. Bart Becht grew rich on our stupidity And so a warm round of applause for Bart Becht, the chief executive who last week took home a pay packet of £92.3m. How cheering it is that even in these straitened times it's still possible to make gazillions of money out of us, the people too stupid to know any better. Mr Becht works for Reckitt Benckiser, a company that, as even he has pointed out in the past, makes some \"very stupid products\". And yet, dumb as they are – and this is the company that gave the world Cillit Bang – we have been proven to be even dumber. It's not just that Cillit Bang is routinely voted the least popular brand in Britain and yet still flies off the shelves. Or even that it contains the kind of chemicals considered handy for cleaning up plutonium stains (a discovery workers at Dounreay nuclear power station made last year). It's that there are few finer examples of how capitalism works than the Reckitt Benckiser model: make something people don't really need, charge them a lot of money for it, then, and – this is the truly brilliant twist – change the name slightly and put the price up. I give you: Finish QuantuMatic or what always used to be called \"detergent\". And Nurofen Express Liquid Capsules, which we pedants call \"ibruprofen\". Except that a packet of 16 Tesco ibruprofen costs 28p and 16 Nurofen Express Capsules costs £3.68. I'd really like to say that anyone who is stupid enough to buy Nurofen deserves to be £3.40 out of pocket and Bart Becht to be paid £92.3m a year. But it's been clinically proved that if you believe Nurofen is better than ibruprofen, it will work better on you. Dammit. It's a refinement of the placebo effect so brilliant it's positively Bechtian. When even our headaches obey the implacable logic of the market, what chance do we have? Nurofen: the analgesic of the masses. As Marx never said. Give me Aintree's fun-lovers over Ascot's ladies Ladies! Lay down your mascara wands and step away from that floral dress. Or do so in the full knowledge that a national newspaper photographer may take a photo of you, print it and hold you up as an object of ridicule and contempt. Last week saw the national annual lampoon a Liverpudlian event, otherwise known as Ladies Day at Aintree, or as the headline in the Mail put it, the \"annual display of orange skin and clashing colours\". It's not just celebrities now who deserve to be photographed from unflattering angles or politicians' wives whose clothing choices are critiqued, it's ordinary people, too, young girls whose only crime is to put on a frock on a sunny spring day. Or as one article put it: \"The worst offenders basked in the spring sunshine sporting acid neons, over-accessorising maxi-dresses with shocking clutch bags and fascinators.\" But then these women are not all of strictly supermodel dimensions. Some are northern. Others are quite possibly working class. Having what looks like a jolly good time. It's Henley, basically, only with people who aren't actively trying to rule you come 6 May.

The deadline for nominations was, after all, only a couple of weeks after Obama took office and his main achievement at that time was to replace George Bush. Partly for that reason, it may not help the new president very much in his domestic battles. The people who are currently accusing him of betraying American interests to please foreigners will see this award as further proof. Especially as it comes so soon after Al Gore's win. However, Obama's success so far has been to defuse a good deal of international tension without giving much away. He has simply plucked the low-hanging diplomatic fruit that had dangled for so long above the Bush administration. The arms control agreement with Russia will be technically complex to complete on deadline in December, but it is straightforward in essence. It is in both countries' interests to dispense with hundreds (and eventually thousands) of surplus warheads that are expensive to maintain. Obama harnessed the task to the long-term vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, which is a cost-free commitment in practice because he conceded it might not happen in his lifetime. But it caught the attention of emerging states without nuclear weapons, whose support is essential to rebuild the tattered nuclear non-proliferation treaty next year. Abandoning the Bush-era plans for missile defence in eastern Europe, removed a huge obstacle to better relations with Russia, again at arguably little cost to national security. The scheme was untested and there were real doubts over whether it would ever work. The short-range system that will replace it, dependent largely on ship-borne Aegis anti-ballistic missiles, will be more effective against the sort of missiles Iran has, and will not be seen as a serious threat by Russia. Likewise, the US-Russian-French offer to Iran to process its uranium, thereby buying time for more diplomacy, is a creative attempt to break the nuclear impasse with Tehran, and find common cause between Washington and Moscow on the issue. It may still be scuppered by the Iranian regime, and does not deal with the heart of the problem, but it offers the hope of defusing tensions at a time the talk has been of possible Israeli military strikes and \"crippling sanctions\". That is quite an impressive list for nine months in office, all achieved by imaginative and energetic diplomacy. But it stops short of solid, irrevocable achievements, which will require real strategic compromises. Obama has not yet persuaded the Pentagon and Congress to sign on to deep cuts in the US Nuclear Posture Review. Negotiations over a new climate change treaty and a new non-proliferation treaty still loom in the months ahead. Iran may spurn everything it is offered and set in motion a Middle East arms race. Israel, the region's only nuclear power, has snubbed Obama and refused to freeze settlement building, setting a Middle East peace deal out of reach for the time being. This Nobel peace prize is a down-payment on work yet to be done. It is an act of faith, based on the fact that Obama is making the right noises and seems to know what he is doing; and on the fact that, compared to his predecessor, he already looks like a master-craftsman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/jun/23/planning.travelandtransport","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-22T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Jackie Ashley: It's no longer populist to put jobs ahead of the climate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/23/planning.travelandtransport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/23/planning.travelandtransport","fields":{"headline":"It's no longer populist to put jobs ahead of the climate","bodyText":"Here we go again. This week, following closely on the row over 42-day detention, another key argument will be fought out on the floor of the Commons. Its implications could hardly be greater. It is about democracy, climate change and daily life - about roads and nuclear power stations, airports and voting. And, yet again, the government finds itself on the wrong side of the argument, with the Tories standing smugly, arms folded, waiting for another Labour political disaster to begin. It is a funny issue, planning: as an abstract, general matter it is regarded as classic, snore-inducing politics of the dullest kind. But when it is your back garden, your cancer threat or your impossibly busy and dangerous road, then planning becomes something that gets people red-faced and perspiring. On Wednesday there will be a key vote on the new planning bill, which looks set to inject the passion of a local campaign against a wind farm, or in favour of a bypass, into the rules of planning itself. The 42-day argument was a vital one of principle, but it will affect only a few people. This, by contrast, will affect almost everyone in the country. More than 60 Labour MPs have signalled their anxiety; there is a real chance of a government defeat. This is not a complicated argument. The government wants to hand over powers to give the planning go-ahead on major projects - such as airport runways, nuclear power stations, motorways and waste dumps - to an unelected commission. It rejected calls for the impact on climate change to be part of the commission's remit. It wants the new system to speed through projects that have been stuck for years in the slow (but democratic) planning system. There is a case for faster planning. If you are seriously worried about climate change, then you may well believe we need not just a new attitude to energy use, but also wind farms, offshore and onshore; more railways; even nuclear power stations. Without arguing pro- or anti-nuclear, let's accept that there is a case for saying: these things are public goods which few people want on their doorstep, and that therefore the needs of the majority, the country, even future generations, should override the complaints of local protesters. Climate change is an urgent matter. Reshaping Britain's infrastructure and energy industry to deal with it is urgent too. It is an argument you will hear a lot from ministers and business over the next few days. It has, sadly, been blown to pieces by the government's refusal to accept that its proposed commission should look at the environmental and climate change effect of a new development before letting it go through. That was lost by 15 votes earlier this month. So if this was about equipping Britain for dealing with climate change, why not write that into the bill? Because, in short, this isn't primarily about climate change at all. It is about business and national growth, and projects that will often run completely counter to environmental needs. It is about Heathrow's proposed third runway, the expansion of regional airports, and more cars on more roads. It is, as the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England put it, a developers' charter. Why has Gordon Brown gone for this? In part, no doubt, for high motives when it comes to big climate change-related developments. He believes a new generation of nuclear power stations is vital to cut emissions, and he knows that under the current system he won't get it in time. But it is also about low politics and fantasy politics. The low politics is that this measure is wanted by business, and Brown wants to cause problems for the Tories. To that extent, things are going well for him. There has been an internal Tory row about the Heathrow expansion, with Alan Duncan, the opposition business spokesman, thought to be much more pro-expansion than David Cameron - who last week committed himself to opposing a third Heathrow runway. Duncan sounded uncomfortable talking about the issue yesterday; and, better still for Brown, the business lobby is furious with Cameron. It is being seen as a \"test\" of the Tory leader's \"pro-business\" attitudes. When Brown goes to the City and talks about taxes, he gets a raspberry. Now, when he talks about planning and \"shallow Conservative opportunism\" he will get applause. Yet what Labour does not seem to have noticed is that outside the lobbying of big business, Cameron's position is bound to be a lot more popular, and Brown sounds incoherent. Are ministers really worried about carbon emissions? If so, why speed up more runways, flights and motorways? Answer: because they care about growth more than they care about climate. That used to be a populist position - wages and jobs first, and let the climate go hang. Cameron thinks the public mood has changed, and the polls suggest he's right. The fantasy politics comes from the almost mythic status that monetary independence for the Bank of England has assumed in the Brown story. It was his most successful single act, so he wants to repeat it. Planning is about balancing different needs. It isn't about expertise or arcane knowledge. A body told to keep inflation low will get on with it. A body told to get things built, will get things built. Remit is all. But deciding if a wind farm is more useful because of the power it generates than it is damaging because of its impact on a landscape - that's about balancing interests. There is no obvious \"right\" answer. It is for politics, and argument, not for closed meetings and phoney experts. So how could this dilemma be resolved? The safeguards and promises about public consultation are meaningless. This bill is meant to rush things through, and that's what its effect would be. If the government turned it into a climate change measure, coinciding with the other green measures it is announcing this week, then that would be a big advance. If it accepted the rebels' other idea, that after the commission, the final say should be with an elected minister, accountable to parliament, then we could have speed and democracy. The rebels are right and the ministers wrong. A government that said climate change was the biggest challenge and said it wanted to give parliament a bigger say is going in the opposite direction. For what? A thin cheer from City types who will never vote Labour, and a passing split inside the shadow cabinet? I've always found Cameron smug. But the man has plenty to be smug about. jackie.ashley@theguardian.com · This correction was published in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday June 30 2008.

Unveiling a budget proposal that would see spending rise to $3.8tn (£2.3tn), pushing this year's federal deficit to a historic high of $1.6tn, Obama held out the prospect of an injection of resources into schools, green energy and the two continuing wars. But he also began to wield the knife, severing his ties to the Kennedy-era aspiration of space travel by cancelling plans to put astronauts back on the moon by 2020 and playing down battered plans for health reform. At a press conference to launch the budget, Obama said: \"We simply cannot continue to spend as if the deficits do not have consequences; as if the tax dollars of the American people can be treated like Monopoly money; as if we can ignore the problem for another generation. We can't. It's time to live within our means once again.\" In a written statement accompanying the budget, Obama emphasised the point. \"We must recognize that the era of irresponsibility in Washington must end. In the long term, we cannot have sustainable and durable economic growth without getting our fiscal house in order.\" But the president was accused of turning his back on five decades of American superiority in space by pulling the plug on plans to send astronauts back to the moon. The president's budget request to Congress lacked the funds to sustain Nasa's $81bn Constellation programme, the spaceships and rockets designed to put humans back on the lunar surface by 2020. Instead, the proposal added $6bn to Nasa's budget over the next five years for \"the building blocks of a more capable approach to space exploration\" – including commercial partnerships to send astronauts into orbit aboard privately developed space \"taxis\". Seeking to put the battles over health reform behind him, Obama said spending on schools would rise by up to $4bn to $29bn. Energy would be another winner at a time when Obama is seeking to create more jobs to ease the pain of 10% unemployment. The energy department's budget would rise by about 7% – almost $2bn – through incentives for the development of renewable energy and nuclear power plants, with extra cash going to encourage research in cutting-edge technologies. The Obama administration is seeking to assuage some of the rightwing anger about record spending and deficit levels by presenting the budget as a moderate package that is neither left nor right. To underline his fiscally responsible credentials, he emphasised a three-year freeze on domestic spending that would save $250bn, and cuts to about 120 federal programmes. But if Obama hoped that by stressing budget discipline he would begin to draw Republicans back into the bipartisan fold, the reaction of party leaders suggested otherwise. Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, criticised the budget as yet more \"binge spending\" that would set the stage \"for the type of economic stagnation we haven't seen since the days of Jimmy Carter\". A conservative thinktank, the Heritage Foundation, said Obama's strategy would see deficit spending rise by up to $2tn over the next decade above the level set last year. \"It's absolutely critical that Obama achieves a fiscally-responsible budget, yet what we are seeing are minute reductions that are hardly the sea-change that is needed,\" said Alison Fraser, the foundation's head of economic policy studies. Against the backdrop of conservative criticism, the White House is gambling on economic conditions swinging in its favour in the short and medium term. It hopes that another tranche of stimulus money – $100bn in the form of a jobs bill including tax cuts for small businesses – will begin to bring down the unemployment figures in time for the mid-term elections in November. That extra spending is partially offset by tax increases on wealthier families, new fees on banks and hedge-fund investors and a removal of tax breaks for oil companies. In the medium term, the administration is gambling that, over the next three years, the country's overall economic performance will improve sufficiently to bring greater federal income through taxes and lower outgoings through falling unemployment benefits. To pave the way for bringing the deficit back under control, the administration is setting up a bi-partisan debt commission of experts to advise on cost-cutting measures. In policy terms, the switch from health to education leaps out. In the wake of the Massachusetts defeat last month, in which the Democrats lost their filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, health reform has become a symbol of the administration's paralysis at the hands of a partisan Congress. By contrast, the administration's ideas for education reform have attracted widespread support from across the political spectrum. The education secretary, Arne Duncan, has embarked on a nationwide tour to publicise the reforms with an unlikely bedfellow: the former Republican leader and architect of the 1990s Contract with America, Newt Gingrich. Highly unusually, the extra money for schools earmarked in the budget has been tied specifically to the passage of legislative changes to George Bush's widely criticised No Child Left Behind policy. Unless those reforms pass through Congress, the money will not be forthcoming - presenting congressional leaders with a clear challenge to break the partisan deadlock. Russ Whitehurst, an education expert at the Brookings Institute, said education had always been high on the agenda for Obama. \"The administration is pushing education up the agenda as they see an opportunity here for bipartisan action, for getting something done,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/sep/01/utilities.britishenergygroup","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-01T14:05:13Z","webTitle":"GDF Suez profits rise 20%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/01/utilities.britishenergygroup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/sep/01/utilities.britishenergygroup","fields":{"headline":"GDF Suez profits rise 20%","bodyText":"GDF Suez, the new French energy group, today posted a 20% leap in first-half earnings as it reaffirmed that it had no interest in buying British Energy, the UK's main nuclear power operator. Gérard Mestrallet, the chief executive, said GDF Suez was keen to be a player in the British nuclear energy market, where the government has been desperately courting another French firm, EDF, to buy British Energy. Announcing pro forma first-half results in Paris, Mestrallet said pre-tax profits rose to €8.1bn on sales up 17% to €43bn on the back of soaring demand and high prices. The group, forged in late July from the €93bn merger of the state-owned gas company GDF with the Franco-Belgian utility Suez, reasserted its target of 10% annual earnings growth to €17bn by 2010. Mestrallet said the group aimed to invest €30bn by the end of 2010 and to secure annual cost savings of €1bn by 2013. The cash-rich group said it would pay its first interim dividend of 80 eurocents, totalling €1.7bn, in late November and aimed to increase the annual payout by up to 15% a year by 2010, when it would reach more than half of net income. It announced a €1bn share buyback before the end of 2008. GDF Suez, which is building a 1.9-gigawatt power station on Teesside, has made plain that it wants to operate at least two of the new-generation nuclear power plants planned by the UK government. It already operates seven nuclear stations in Belgium, where it is the biggest energy supplier, trading as Electrabel, and recently sold off a 25.1% stake in rival SPE to Centrica. The British Gas owner, which is still a potential partner of EDF and/or GDF Suez in the British nuclear power programme, now has majority control of SPE. The group, which has 11% of its power capacity in nuclear, has signalled that it could take part in building the second new-generation EPR reactor planned by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. It is investing heavily in renewable energy, including wind and hydro. Jean-Francois Cirelli, the deputy chief executive and a former head of GDF, said a government cap on gas prices had cost it almost €180m in the first half and more than €1bn since 2004. He said the group was experiencing no gas supply problems with Russia despite its political tensions with the EU. Shares in the group bucked the falling trend on France's main market, rising around 2%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2009/nov/20/polar-bears-plane-stupid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-20T10:22:35Z","webTitle":"Plane Stupid's shock ads linking flights with polar bear deaths could fall flat | Ed Gillespie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/nov/20/polar-bears-plane-stupid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2009/nov/20/polar-bears-plane-stupid","fields":{"headline":"Plane Stupid's shock ads linking flights with polar bear deaths could fall flat","bodyText":"The high-pitched whine of a low-flying jet engine fills the air as the camera tracks across images of shimmering glass buildings, the Towers of Mammon in an unidentified urban CBD. No, this is not the opening credits of The Apprentice, and dropping out of the sky is not UK Business Czar \"Sralan\" Sugar in his helicopter, but huge, hairy half-tonne polar bears. Their falls are (presumably deliberately) reminiscent of jumpers from the 911 towers and with visceral violence the poor ursine beasts crash cruelly into the concrete and tarmac with sickening thuds. The effect is shocking; the message brutal: every short haul flight you take emits four hundred kilogrammes of carbon dioxide – the equivalent weight of an adult polar bear. This is the new promotional film from anti-aviation expansion campaigners Plane Stupid. It's the latest in a series of climate change \"shock ads\" ranging from Greenpeace's now slightly dated Friday the 13th in which a hijacked plane is flown into Sizewell nuclear power station while a family playing on the beach stands agog, to the government's own recent Bedtime Stories short that ran as part of the wider, ongoing ACT on CO2 campaign. We expect Greenpeace and Plane Stupid to be a bit more challenging in their approach, but in Bedtime Stories, as my colleague Henry put it rather eloquently it's as if the \"green police\" are climbing into bed with your children and telling them that, unless daddy turns the TV off standby, Mr Snuggles the dog sleeps with the fishes. Stop climate change or the puppy gets it is not exactly the best motivational message ever. And this inevitably begs the question do these shock tactics actually work to shift the public's attitudes and behaviours? Conventional psychological theory suggests that shock ads used to work because their message wormed its way so deeply into our consciousness that we're eventually compelled to act on it. However we swiftly become desensitized and I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of the over-hyped plight of the plucky polar bear in the context of climate change and the role of flying in fuelling the phenomenon. But maybe the ad works by ramming home this link between high-carbon short haul flights and the fate of the Arctic? Certainly it's controversial imagery will garner press interest, after all I'm writing this analytical blog for starters, and for campaigning organisations with limited budgets and only one bite at the media cherry this is crucial. However I'm still not sure it will change behaviour, the danger is that by pumping up the high octane drama of an ad, you increase the risk of viewers feeling manipulated and dismissing it as pure propaganda. Or lapsing into highly questionable failures of tact and taste in pursuit of 'edginess'. Far more effective I believe are the Airplot campaign by Greenpeace, led by the positive, party-style property-buying intervention in Sipson or the Trains vs Planes virals from the Campaign for Better Transport. Shock ads work best when the consequences of the behaviour we wish to change are immediate, tangible and personal such as using a condom to prevent STDs or not drink driving. They are less effective when the \"costs\" are long term, uncertain and shared such as with passive smoking or climate change. This is why health campaigns like Change4life on obesity have concentrated on helping people do something positive rather than dwelling on the negative outcomes of inaction. As climate evidence mounts up and the likelihood of anything meaningful coming out of the formerly crucial Copenhagen negotiations in December diminishes with every passing day the temptation to become shriller, angrier and more shocking in climate campaigning communications will only grow. The risk is that this will simply step up the vilification of public behaviour, leading to people increasingly ignoring the very real threat of climate change and their responsibility in driving it. Now that really would be shocking. • Ed Gillespie is co-director of sustainable communications agency Futerra."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/mar/17/gordon-brown-iran-nuclear-programme","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-17T13:35:00Z","webTitle":"Gordon Brown pushes for world reduction in nuclear weapons as he makes Iran offer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/17/gordon-brown-iran-nuclear-programme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/mar/17/gordon-brown-iran-nuclear-programme","fields":{"headline":"Brown pushes for world reduction in nuclear weapons as he makes Iran offer","bodyText":"The UK is to push for a new multilateral deal to reduce the number of nuclear weapons stockpiled around the world, Gordon Brown said today, as he pledged that Britain was \"ready\" to reduce its own number of Trident warheads. In his first speech on nuclear disarmament since May, Brown said that a new deal to reduce world stockpiles of atomic weapons was close. \"Britain has cut the number of its nuclear warheads by 50% since 1997 ... If it is possible to reduce the number of UK warheads further, consistent with our national deterrence requirements and with the progress of multilateral discussions, Britain will be ready to do so,\" he said. \"We must begin by reducing the number of nuclear weapons still out there in the world ... Between them, the US and Russia retain around 95%.\" In the same speech the prime minister renewed his offer to Iran for international help in developing a civil nuclear power industry providing Tehran ends its uranium enrichment programme. The prime minister said Iran's atomic programme had become a \"critical\" threat in his first comments on the country since a February International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) report showed that Tehran had not suspended enrichment. Brown laid out plans for a \"uranium enrichment bond\" whereby nuclear power-producing countries would guarantee the supply of enriched uranium to those countries that were not self-sufficient, providing safeguards were in place. The government would also like to see enhanced powers of inspection. Insiders said the speech was the prime minister's chance to present his plan ahead of Barack Obama's visit to the UK for the G20 summit on 2 April. The IAEA said last month that Tehran had succeeded in enriching a tonne of uranium, technically giving it enough for a single warhead. The US has developed its position on Iran's non-civilian nuclear programme since Obama's inauguration. The US president sent a secret letter to the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that the deployment of America's proposed $4bn-a-year missile shield in eastern Europe could be halted if Moscow persuaded Tehran to abandon its nuclear weapon ambitions. Obama views Russia as critical to his efforts to halt Iran's suspected nuclear weapons programme. However, it is thought that the new US administration is holding off from developing a distinct new line until Iranian elections in June. At Lancaster House in London today, Brown set out means to help non-nuclear states acquire the new sources of energy they need while still meeting international commitments halving carbon emissions by 2050 – something Downing Street aides said would require the building of 32 nuclear reactors around the world each year for the foreseeable future. The prime minister said: \"Iran is a test case for this new philosophy of the right to civil nuclear power with sanctions for rule breakers. Let me be unequivocal: Iran has the same absolute right to a peaceful civil nuclear programme as any other country. Indeed, the UK and international community stand ready to help Iran achieve it. \"But let me be equally clear that Iran's current nuclear programme is unacceptable. Iran has concealed nuclear activities, refused to cooperate with the IAEA, and flouted UN security council resolutions. Its refusal to play by the rules leads us to view its nuclear programme as a critical proliferation threat. \"Iran therefore faces a clear choice: continue in this way and face further and tougher sanctions, or change to a UN-overseen civil nuclear energy programme that will bring the greatest benefits to its citizens.\" Brown also reaffirmed his long-term commitment to see the world \"getting to zero\", which would see the international community commit to abolishing nuclear weapons. Brown's adviser on nuclear non-proliferation, the Liberal Democrat peer Lady Williams, called on him to take action on what she called a \"drastic decline of British nuclear knowledge\". She said: \"Nagasaki was 70 years ago and there are now left very few people who know anything about it. There is now a very real worry that there will not be enough skilled people to fill the inspections.\" A Downing Street spokesman suggested patience was running out, saying: \"The government made a generous offer to Iran in the summer – we will help you with enrichment of uranium – but so far we have not had a satisfactory response to that.\" Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has previously rejected similar offers, most recently last summer from the so-called E3+3 group – Britain, France and Germany, plus the US, Russia and China. The defence secretary, John Hutton, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Brown's speech was \"a restatement of what our policy is and an invitation to Iran – and I think a very important one – to come back within the framework of international law and develop its civilian nuclear power programme in a way that doesn't pose the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation\". Hutton said Britain backed Iran's right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but remained concerned that Tehran was in breach of five UN security council resolutions regarding its nuclear activities. \"We are entitled to regard it as a proliferation threat,\" he said. \"The consequences for Iran are very clear – they can continue facing international isolation or they can come back within the framework of international law.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/27/goodbye-noughties-carbon-taxes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-27T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"I've changed my mind about carbon taxes | Tim Leunig","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/27/goodbye-noughties-carbon-taxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/27/goodbye-noughties-carbon-taxes","fields":{"headline":"I've changed my mind about carbon taxes","bodyText":"I am an economist, not a natural scientist. I have no way of telling, personally, whether global warming is occurring. But scientists, taken as a whole, seem pretty convinced, and I trust my economist colleague (Lord) Nick Stern's review of the evidence. And whether it is man-made or natural climate change doesn't matter: it will harm a lot of people, and we can prevent or reduce that by cutting carbon emissions. I am an economist, and so I supported a carbon tax. A carbon tax means that we can leave it to the market to find the lowest-cost way of reducing global warming, with governments setting the tax at the rate necessary to bring global warming emissions within appropriate levels as determined by natural scientists. But I have changed my mind. I still think that global warming is happening. I still think people should do something about it. I am still an economist. But I no longer believe in carbon taxes, or at least not in isolation. My reasons are simple: over the last few years I have spent a lot of time studying UK housing markets. In many ways UK housing is very similar to carbon. We have decided (admittedly not for very good reasons) to build on no more than about 10% of Britain's land, with the remaining 90% reserved as green space. This is similar, analytically, to carbon: compared with current carbon emissions, we need to cut down by (say) 90% over the medium term. Now imagine a carbon tax: everyone would make some changes, but with the carbon price going up dramatically, to a huge extent the rich would get the carbon and the poor would not. It is just the same as with housing. Rich people in Britain do live in smaller houses than rich people in the US, but the main feature of Britain's housing is that rich people live in bigger houses than poor people – and are more likely to have two of them. Or for those as rich as former non-dom Zac Goldsmith, who knows how many? If we had a carbon tax, who knows what the price would have to be to get the effects we need? We get a sense by looking at the London congestion charge, which reduced journeys by chargeable vehicles by about a third. But the charge – initially £5 a day – equated to about 50p a mile within the area. Assuming a car does six miles to the litre, typical for London's stop-start conditions, and that is the equivalent of putting £3 on the price of a litre of petrol. So when petrol is £18.40 a gallon, people in the city with the best public transport in Britain use their cars 30% less. How high would petrol tax have to be to get petrol use down by, say, 80-90%? Cars would, once again, only be for the very affluent. Goldsmith will still be able to afford one. But the rest of us will be walking. The reality is that prices work very well when supply is able to increase when the price goes up. If demand for clothing goes up, people plant more cotton. But prices don't work very well to ration a given amount of goods. Sure, auctions can allocate Van Goghs between a handful of mega rich people effectively, because frankly most of us don't care whether Goldsmith has a Van Gogh or not. But prices don't work well for goods where supply is limited and society does care who has them. That is why we have social housing, and housing benefit – without them, millions of families would live in slums because they simply would not be able to afford the frankly ridiculous housing costs that we take for granted in Britain today. And the same is true for carbon. If carbon was a luxury good, like Van Gogh paintings, then a carbon tax that resulted in only rich people being able to afford carbon would be fine. But when almost all of us rely on gas central heating, and carbon-based electricity, when we all-but-need cars to get around, then a carbon tax sufficient to combat global warming means misery for millions. Instead we need regulations. It is nuts that one alarm clock will use five times as much electricity as another. It is nuts that it is legal to sell or rent an existing house with walls and windows that leak heat galore. It is nuts that we are not building nuclear power stations as fast as we can. It is nuts to be even thinking of building an energy-guzzling high-speed rail line. It is nuts to have a complex annual vehicle excise tax instead of a CO2-proportionate tax on cars at point of sale, when people make the decision as to which car to buy and run. Economists rarely favour regulation over prices. But when the product is limited and distribution matters, it is the only answer. That is why regulation, and not a carbon tax, should be the smarter economists' answer to global warming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2010/feb/14/china-strength-doubts-future","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-14T00:06:26Z","webTitle":"Growing strength of China masks doubts about future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/14/china-strength-doubts-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/feb/14/china-strength-doubts-future","fields":{"headline":"Growing strength of China masks doubts about future","bodyText":"China last night heralded the lunar new year with the usual deafening, dazzling pyrotechnics. But outside the country, some fear the year of the tiger will see another kind of fireworks, as a newly confident world power asserts itself globally. \"China is getting stronger and stronger. You can see it from the happy faces coming to buy firecrackers,\" declared stallholder Han Jing, as she handed out rockets and other wares from her busy booth in north Beijing. In the economic crisis, it was not affected as badly as other countries. Our Chinese people have confidence that it will overtake every other country.\" Grabbing a bumper packet of explosives, her customer Zhou Liyuan agreed. \"At least the British drug smuggler [Akmal Shaikh] was executed. In the past, there would have been more negotiations. There are a lot of conflicts between China and the US now, and we have a stronger point of view this time.\" Recent weeks have seen disputes with the west over everything from trade to climate change. In Europe and the US, business people and officials grumble privately of the increasing assertiveness – arrogance, say many – of this growing power. \"I think 2009 has been a turning point,\" said Professor Feng Zhongping, director of European relations at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. \"If you say China is more confident, that would be accurate. But I think there have been misunderstandings by the US and European governments and especially the media. I don't think China has become 'prickly'.\" From the western perspective, China has been unwilling to shoulder the responsibilities that go alongside greater international power: failing to press Iran and North Korea on nuclear proliferation or to make a serious commitment to tackling climate change; punishing other countries with its artificially low currency. It has brushed aside criticism on human rights and sought to export censorship, pressing overseas film festivals to drop documentaries on Tibet and Xinjiang. But some of the recent tension has been overplayed. President Obama's predecessors also met the Dalai Lama and China objected in each case. The two are scheduled to meet on Thursday. Analysts also say Beijing has exerted more pressure on North Korea of late. From Beijing's point of view, the west is making unrealistic demands – expecting it not only to understand other countries' priorities, but also to compromise its own interests. \"Some people's expectation of China was that, with economic development, foreign policy and political reform would become westernised,\" said Feng. A lot of people don't think a responsible great power just does what the US expects it to do.\" Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies, argued that the US shopping list was increasingly long. \"The arms sales to Taiwan and the visit of the Dalai Lama take place at a time they need help on Iran… What are the top three issues for America? If they put Tibet or Taiwan in there, I would be amazed,\" he said. That helps to explain why China sees no point in yielding on certain issues. \"Beijing's new assertiveness is less the result of its growing economic clout than the realisation that [ultimately] western governments care far less about human rights than about trade and economics,\" said Nicholas Bequelin, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. Elsewhere in the world, China's rise is met with as much enthusiasm as fear. Neighbours may be alarmed by its growing might, but there is greater enthusiasm on other continents. Professor Deborah Brautigam, whose recent book The Dragon's Gift examines the Chinese presence in Africa, said that, while some there see China as \"the new colonialist\", others have welcomed it. \"African leaders and commentators expressing this view are not naive about Chinese interest in Africa. But they actually like to hear the Chinese talk about investment opportunities instead of aid [and] are intrigued by models such as the resource-backed infrastructure loans,\" she said. Analysts predict further tension, rather than a spectacular confrontation, between China and the west. Gao argues that the stakes are too high for both sides. \"The decision-makers in this town are cautious, prudent people; not because they are afraid of the other side, but because they know increasing friction is bad for China, bad for the US and bad for the world,\" he said. Beijing may be increasingly confident, but it does not yet believe its smooth ascendancy is a given. Underneath the veneer of confidence lie persistent anxieties about the true strength of its economy and society, and how to handle issues such as soaring inequality and endemic corruption. Such domestic vulnerabilities enhance the appeal of promoting popular nationalism, yet also reinforce the potential dangers of international disputes. \"What many observers see [as greater assertiveness] is in fact the product of a larger debate and policy struggle in Beijing about where China should be in the next 10 years and how it should get there,\" argued Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based political analyst. The only real agreement thus far is that China is not to be pushed around, and so you get over-reaction and elbowing and jersey-tugging from many officials here.\" And at street level, while many ordinary Chinese people celebrate their country's rise with pride, others are deeply cynical about its prospects. \"We're a nuclear power, but are we prepared to use military power against anyone?\" complained another of Han's fireworks buyers, who declined to give his name. \"The statistics that China provides about its economy are all fake. A lot of graduates can't get jobs. When outsiders come to Beijing it takes seven or 10 years to get a hukou [household registration], yet getting a US green card might not take them that long. I'm not sure whether China's stronger as a country – but its citizens aren't.\" If such pessimistic judg ments prove well-founded, the Chinese political establishment may face as much pressure from within as without, as it attempts to consolidate superpower status in 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/nov/16/iran-nuclear-united-nations-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-16T20:09:01Z","webTitle":"Iran could have more secret nuclear sites, warns UN nuclear watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/16/iran-nuclear-united-nations-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/nov/16/iran-nuclear-united-nations-report","fields":{"headline":"Iran could have more secret nuclear sites, warns UN nuclear watchdog","bodyText":"The United Nations nuclear watchdog has expressed fears that Iran may have other secret nuclear sites following the discovery of the facility hidden in a mountain near the holy city of Qom. The International Atomic Energy Agency, in a report published today, said the previously secret site at Fordo was in \"an advanced state of construction\" and was scheduled to start up in 2011. The IAEA reprimanded Iran for failing to inform it until September about the site, even though construction had begun at least two years ago. In a more pointed criticism of Iran than usual, the IAEA says the delay \"reduces the level of confidence in the absence of other nuclear facilities under construction and gives rise to questions about whether there were any other nuclear facilities not declared to the agency\". The expression of concern comes at a sensitive moment, with no sign of a peace deal between Iran and the US, backed by Britain, France and Germany. Iran has not yet formally replied to a compromise offered by Barack Obama, who said at the weekend that time was running out. The IAEA sent inspectors to the Fordo site late last month but today indicated it is to seek clarification on several issues, in particular how long the Fordo site had been planned. The report said that technicians had moved sophisticated technical equipment into the uranium enrichment facility situated deep inside the mountain. An IAEA official said the facility was designed to produce about a ton of enriched uranium a year, enough for a small warhead. The report quotes Iran insisting it \"did not have any other nuclear facilities that were currently under construction or in operation that had not yet been declared to the agency\". Iran claims it is only intent on using nuclear energy to help meet its electricity needs. The report is the last by the controversial head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, who has been accused by the US of being too soft on Iran. In contrast with the concern expressed in the report, ElBaradei only last week, in an interview with the New York Times, played down the significance of the previously undisclosed site, saying it was \"nothing to worry about\". The report may reflect the thinking of the IAEA's inspectors and ElBaradei's political staff, who have tended to be more sceptical about Iran's intentions than their chief. The US, along with Britain, France and Germany, claims that discovery of the Fordo site puts Iran in breach of its international treaty obligations. Although Iran reported its existence to the IAEA in September, the US said this was to pre-empt an announcement exposing the site. Iran said work on the site only began in 2007 but the US said it started in 2002-04 and, after a pause, resumed in 2006. The IAEA reprimanded Iran, saying its \"failure to notify the agency of the new facility until September 2009 was inconsistent with its obligations\". Israel has threatened military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities to prevent it acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. The report said it was concern about just such an attack that prompted Iran to build the facility inside the mountain, according to a letter from Iran to the IAEA on 28 October. \"As a result of the augmentation of the threats of military attacks against Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran decided to establish contingency centres for various organisations and activities,\" the report said. The Federation of American Scientists, which tracks nuclear proliferation, said today: \"Of course, there is the question of whether Fordo is simply the only 'secret' facility that we know about. The danger is that there are other facilities that can escape safeguards because the IAEA does not know about them.\" It added: \"The good news in this story is that the facility is now known and the IAEA kicked in exactly as it should.\" Russia today dashed Iranian hopes that a Russian-built nuclear reactor at Iran's southern port Bushehr will be switched on this year, providing Iran with its first operating nuclear power plant. Iranian parliamentarians reacted angrily to the Russian announcement. Russia has long backed Iran in the nuclear stand-off, blocking tough UN security council sanctions, but Obama has been pressing Russian leaders to join the US, Britain, France and Germany in a show of solidarity on the nuclear issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2009/may/06/trident-faslane-nuclear-submarines","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-06T22:13:26Z","webTitle":"UK's entire nuclear submarine fleet to be based in Scotland at Faslane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/06/trident-faslane-nuclear-submarines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2009/may/06/trident-faslane-nuclear-submarines","fields":{"headline":"UK's entire nuclear submarine fleet to be based in Scotland at Faslane","bodyText":"Britain's entire nuclear submarine fleet is to be based at Faslane on the Clyde, prompting Tory charges tonight that the government is allowing the \"Scottish agenda\" to threaten English jobs. The Tories spoke out after Bob Ainsworth, the defence minister, announced that all classes of submarines will be based at Faslane from 2017. The four Vanguard class submarines, which carry Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent, are already based in Faslane. But from 2017 the remaining three nuclear-powered Trafalgar Class submarines, which do not carry nuclear warheads, will be moved from Devonport in Plymouth to Faslane. The decision was condemned by the Tories tonight. Gary Streeter, the MP for Devon South West, said: \"I fear that the Devonport naval base is going to be allowed to wither on the vine over the next five to 10 years. It has had 320 years of history. We will have the amphibious fleet, but that is three boats and not much else. That is not going to replace all these frigates and submarines.\" He said it was unwise to base Trident and its replacement in Scotland, which has a nationalist government committed to leaving the UK. \"The Trident fleet is moored in what might be a foreign country. Scotland could become a foreign country. How wise is that? If Devonport is allowed to wither on the vine and Scotland does have independence in seven years time we will have to rush the submarines away – but where are we going to out them?\" Streeter said he was particularly angry because English jobs were being jeopardised by an attempt to appease the Scots. \"It always seems to end up with a battle between the south coast of England and a place in Scotland. There is always heavy politics involved, whether it is Rosyth or Faslane. It wouldn't surprise me at all if there wasn't a significant Scottish agenda behind this. I think we might have been caught up in that battle. Many of my constituents feel the Scottish agenda has fed into this agenda.\" The decision to base all the UK's nuclear submarines at Faslane raises the prospect of a future nationalist government in Scotland forcing a referendum on independence and demanding the removal of the entire fleet to an English base. Labour ministers in London are challenging the fiercely anti-nuclear Scottish National party, which is currently predicted to retain power after the 2011 Scottish parliamentary elections, over its refusal to build new nuclear power stations in Scotland, believing most voters support nuclear power and the nuclear deterrent. Although most Scots, including a number of Labour backbenchers and MSPs, object to nuclear weapons being based at the Clyde base, ministers calculate that strengthening the economic significance of Faslane and its status as part of the UK's armed forces will damage support for the SNP amongst ordinary voters. The Ministry of Defence says Faslane currently supports 11,000 jobs: the base is the largest single-site employer in Scotland. One of Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's closest aides said a future Tory government could easily reverse today's decision, in favour of English bases, while the SNP had pledged to use Faslane as Scotland's main naval base under independence. \"There's very much the whiff of the last days of empire around this government,\" he said. \"I suspect decisions taken by this administration will have no bearing on decisions next year, never mind 2017.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/jan/14/nuclear-power-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-14T15:05:25Z","webTitle":"E.ON and RWE to build new nuclear plants in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/14/nuclear-power-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jan/14/nuclear-power-uk","fields":{"headline":"E.ON and RWE team up to build new nuclear plants in Britain","bodyText":"Two of the biggest gas and electricity providers in Britain have joined forces in their bid to build up to three nuclear plants in the UK in the latest sign of an increasing commitment to atomic power. E.ON and RWE, both German-owned, said their 50:50 partnership aimed to construct and operate 6 gigawatts of new generating capacity on sites that are being sold off by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The move follows the final agreement on the £12.5bn EDF takeover of British Energy last week which gave new impetus to the French utility's determination to construct atomic stations in Britain. The companies said that their partnership gave them the \"financial stability and balance sheet strength\" required to support the kind of large investment needed while industry experts said it also made clear the Germans would be the main competitors in the British nuclear sector to the French in future. E.ON and RWE have stakes in 20 nuclear power stations around the world. They already jointly own three nuclear reactors in Germany. \"New nuclear build is a key part of RWE npower's commitment to meet the UK's energy needs and to reduce carbon dioxide intensity. E.ON is the ideal partner for UK development given that our businesses have complementary strengths and capabilities, and a successful track record in nuclear power,\" said Andrew Duff, chief executive of RWE npower. \"The UK power industry needs significant investment to replace ageing coal and nuclear plant and to drive the change to a lower carbon economy. This joint venture will deliver an early, substantial and vital contribution from nuclear power. At the same time, large infrastructure projects can bring major benefits to the UK economy through jobs, direct investment and supply chain opportunities,\" he added. Paul Golby, his counterpart at E.ON UK, said: \"The UK has to replace a third of its generating capacity in the next 15 years in a way that ensures security of supply, reduces carbon emissions and keeps energy as affordable as possible. \"The only way we can achieve this is to have a diverse energy mix, and new nuclear power, alongside cleaner fossil fuels, renewables and energy efficiency, will be vital going forward.\" RWE has made clear in the past that it would like to construct a new 3.6gw plant at Wylfa on the Isle of Anglesey where an existing reactor is coming to the end of its life. E.ON has also expressed interest in different sites while EDF wants to construct four stations on land owned by British Energy, the main UK atomic power generator using designs developed by fellow French firm, Areva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/aug/16/carbon-capture-gas-power-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-16T19:06:38Z","webTitle":"Energy experts call for carbon capture scheme for gas fired power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/16/carbon-capture-gas-power-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/aug/16/carbon-capture-gas-power-generation","fields":{"headline":"Energy experts call for carbon capture scheme for gas fired power stations","bodyText":"New gas plants should be subject to the same rules that force new coal plants to fit carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, according to leading energy bosses. Experts fear that the government's new policy on CCS for coal power will lead to a boom in the construction of gas plants which do not have to bury their carbon emissions. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, said there was no point forcing only new coal plants to fit the expensive and largely untried technology. \"We have to have a consistent rule applying to everyone. If you want to decarbonise electricity we need to do it [fit CCS to gas plants].' Joan MacNaughton, senior vice-president at Alstom, the power generation firm, formerly one of the government's most senior energy advisers, said that CCS should be fitted to new gas plants soon. \"We can't do everything at once,\" she said. \"That means fitting CCS technology to new coal plants is the priority as they produce more emissions. But we do have to do new gas plants pretty soon. Building more 'unabated' fossil fuel plants for years to come would just mean we have a much bigger problem to tackle later on.\" In April, energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband announced that new coal plants built in Britain would have to capture about a quarter of their carbon emissions from the outset. Once CCS technology has been technically and commercially proved, which could take at least a decade, all the plants' emissions will have to be captured. The government launched a consultation on its new CCS policy, which closes early next month. The policy appeased some campaigners concerned about the environmental impact of new coal plants planned for the UK because coal power is one of the most carbon-intensive ways to generate electricity. As a result of the policy, only the handful of coal plants which qualify for government financial support to fit the technology will be built, prompting concern that unabated gas plants could fill the generation gap. Power generation firms expect they will have to fit CCS technology to their gas plants at some point. EDF Energy's gas plant under construction at West Burton has been designed as \"carbon capture ready\" so equipment can be fitted later. The government has set a target of reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. To have any chance of meeting this, all electricity generation would have to come from renewables and low carbon technologies such as nuclear power and fossil fuel plants which have CCS fitted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/sep/30/climate-bill-greenhouse-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-30T18:27:43Z","webTitle":"Senate Democrats unveil climate bill calling for a 20% cut in emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/30/climate-bill-greenhouse-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/sep/30/climate-bill-greenhouse-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Senate Democrats unveil climate bill calling for a 20% cut in emissions","bodyText":"Democratic leaders took on the epic challenge of getting the US Senate to act on global warming today with the formal unveiling of a bill proposing an ambitious 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions. Senate Democrats turned out in strength for today's launch, which was seen at home and abroad as a crucial moment for advancing Barack Obama's agenda. But the difficulties ahead were underscored by the senators' deep reluctance to use the words 'climate change' — even in the title of the bill, which is called the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act. Instead, senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer couched their bill as a chance for America to reclaim its energy independence by reducing oil imports. \"This is a security bill that puts Americans back in charge of our energy future,\" said Kerry. \"It is our country's defence against the harms of pollution and the security risks of global climate change.\" Today's bill sets out a more ambitious target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions than the 17% cut from 2005 levels by 2020 passed by the House of Representatives in June. The draft would push for a 20% reduction from 2005 levels by 2020 and an 83% reduction by 2050. The targets appear chosen for their resonance with European and Asian leaders. International negotiators have been looking to America to demonstrate commitment to action on climate change ahead of a meeting at Copenhagen in December cast by the United Nations as a last chance to avoid catastrophic warming. Otherwise, the bill appeared constructed according to advice of pollsters, which have regularly advised Democrats to cloak climate change action in the language of green job creation and national security. In a summary released today, Kerry and Boxer said their bill was aimed at \"putting America back in control of our energy future, reasserting American economic leadership and competitiveness, protecting our families from pollution, and ensuring our national security\". They began by laying out $10bn (£6.3bn) over 10 years for research into carbon capture technology and for pledging a greater role for nuclear power in America's energy mix. The summary promised \"robust border measures\" against states which do not act to cut carbon emissions, presumably China and India. It also sought to downplay the significance of its emissions cuts, arguing that fewer than 2% of American businesses would be affected. \"The system applies only to the largest polluters in the country - initially around 7,500 facilities that account for nearly three-quarters of US carbon pollution. Over 98% of American businesses, including farmers, are not covered by this programme,\" the summary said. Despite such manoeuvring, it is far from clear that the Senate will be able to pivot from its battles over healthcare to climate change and make significant progress before the Copenhagen meeting. The 800-page draft bill, which is still being worked on, is almost certain to undergo significant changes in the coming weeks with Democrats struggling to build support even from within their own ranks. \"Complex processes are part and parcel of passing major legislation,\" Tony Kreindler of the Environmental Defence Fund said. \"The most important thing is that the draft be taken for what it is: a starting point that Senators can work with, tailor and pass.\" Republicans, who are expected to largely oppose the bill, organised their own counter-press conference today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2007/nov/20/foreignpolicy.usa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-20T00:18:25Z","webTitle":"George Monbiot: The Middle East has had a secretive nuclear power in its midst for years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/20/foreignpolicy.usa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/20/foreignpolicy.usa","fields":{"headline":"The Middle East has had a secretive nuclear power in its midst for years","bodyText":"George Bush and Gordon Brown are right: there should be no nuclear weapons in the Middle East. The risk of a nuclear conflagration could be greater there than anywhere else. Any nation developing them should expect a firm diplomatic response. So when will they impose sanctions on Israel? Like them, I believe that Iran is trying to acquire the bomb. I also believe it should be discouraged, by a combination of economic pressure and bribery, from doing so (a military response would, of course, be disastrous). I believe that Bush and Brown - who maintain their nuclear arsenals in defiance of the non-proliferation treaty - are in no position to lecture anyone else. But if, as Bush claims, the proliferation of such weapons \"would be a dangerous threat to world peace\", why does neither man mention the fact that Israel, according to a secret briefing by the US Defence Intelligence Agency, possesses between 60 and 80 of them? Officially, the Israeli government maintains a position of \"nuclear ambiguity\": neither confirming nor denying its possession of nuclear weapons. But everyone who has studied the issue knows that this is a formula with a simple purpose: to give the United States an excuse to keep breaking its own laws, which forbid it to grant aid to a country with unauthorised weapons of mass destruction. The fiction of ambiguity is fiercely guarded. In 1986, when the nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu handed photographs of Israel's bomb factory to the Sunday Times, he was lured from Britain to Rome, drugged and kidnapped by Mossad agents, tried in secret, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He served 12 of them in solitary confinement and was banged up again - for six months - soon after he was released. However, in December last year, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, accidentally let slip that Israel, like \"America, France and Russia\", had nuclear weapons. Opposition politicians were furious. They attacked Olmert for \"a lack of caution bordering on irresponsibility\". But US aid continues to flow without impediment. As the fascinating papers released last year by the National Security Archive show, the US government was aware in 1968 that Israel was developing a nuclear device (what it didn't know is that the first one had already been built by then). The contrast to the efforts now being made to prevent Iran from acquiring the bomb could scarcely be starker. At first, US diplomats urged Washington to make its sale of 50 F4 Phantom jets conditional on Israel's abandonment of its nuclear programme. As a note sent from the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to the secretary of state in October 1968 reveals, the order would make the US \"the principal supplier of Israel's military needs\" for the first time. In return, it should require \"commitments that would make it more difficult for Israel to take the critical decision to go nuclear\". Such pressure, the memo suggested, was urgently required: France had just delivered the first of a consignment of medium range missiles, and Israel intended to equip them with nuclear warheads. Twenty days later, on November 4 1968, when the assistant defence secretary met Yitzhak Rabin (then the Israeli ambassador to Washington), Rabin \"did not dispute in any way our information on Israel's nuclear or missile capability\". He simply refused to discuss it. Four days after that, Rabin announced that the proposal was \"completely unacceptable to us\". On November 27, Lyndon Johnson's administration accepted Israel's assurance that \"it will not be the first power in the Middle East to introduce nuclear weapons\". As the memos show, US officials knew that this assurance had been broken even before it was made. A record of a phone conversation between Henry Kissinger and another official in July 1969 reveals that Richard Nixon was \"very leery of cutting off the Phantoms\", despite Israel's blatant disregard of the agreement. The deal went ahead, and from then on the US administration sought to bamboozle its own officials in order to defend Israel's lie. In August 1969, US officials were sent to \"inspect\" Israel's Dimona nuclear plant. But a memo from the state department reveals that \"the US government is not prepared to support a 'real' inspection effort in which the team members can feel authorised to ask directly pertinent questions and/or insist on being allowed to look at records, logs, materials and the like. The team has in many subtle ways been cautioned to avoid controversy, 'be gentlemen' and not take issue with the obvious will of the hosts\". Nixon refused to pass the minutes of the conversation he'd had with the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, to the US ambassador to Israel, Wally Barbour. Meir and Nixon appear to have agreed that the Israeli programme could go ahead, as long as it was kept secret. The US government has continued to protect it. Every six months, the intelligence agencies provide Congress with a report on technology acquired by foreign states that's \"useful for the development or production of weapons of mass destruction\". These reports discuss the programmes in India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran and other nations, but not in Israel. Whenever other states have tried to press Israel to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the US and European governments have blocked them. Israel has also exempted itself from the biological and chemical weapons conventions. By refusing to sign these treaties, Israel ensures it needs never be inspected. While the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspectors crawl round Iran's factories, put seals on its uranium tanks and blow the whistle when it fails to cooperate, they have no legal authority to inspect facilities in Israel. So when the Israeli government complains, as it did last week, that the head of the IAEA is \"sticking his head in the sand over Iran's nuclear programme\", you can only gape at its chutzpah. Israel is constantly racking up the pressure for action against Iran, aware that no powerful state will press for action against Israel. Yes, Iran under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a dangerous and unpredictable state involved in acts of terror abroad. The president is a Holocaust denier opposed to the existence of Israel. During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran responded to Saddam Hussein's toxic bombardments with chemical weapons of its own. But Israel under Olmert is also a dangerous and unpredictable state involved in acts of terror abroad. Two months ago it bombed a site in Syria (whose function is fiercely disputed). Last year, it launched a war of aggression against Lebanon. It remains in occupation of Palestinian lands. In February 2001, according to the BBC, it used chemical weapons in Gaza: 180 people were admitted to hospital with severe convulsions. Nuclear weapons in Israel's hands are surely just as dangerous as nuclear weapons in Iran's. So when will our governments speak up? When will they acknowledge that there is already a nuclear power in the Middle East, and that it presents an existential threat to its neighbours? When will they admit that Iran is not starting a nuclear arms race, but joining one? When will they demand that the rules they impose on Iran should also apply to Israel? monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/jun/25/korean-war-haven-south-defectors-north","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-24T23:05:10Z","webTitle":"Korean war 60 years on: Haven in South for young defectors from North","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/korean-war-haven-south-defectors-north","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jun/25/korean-war-haven-south-defectors-north","fields":{"headline":"Korean war 60 years on: Haven in South for young defectors from North","bodyText":"Perched nervously on the edge of a chair in the principal's office, a hole visible in one knee of his uniform, Kim Yong-hee visibly relaxes when he talks about his recently discovered talent for table tennis and love of martial arts films. An interest in sport and movies, however, is perhaps all he has in common with other teenage boys in South Korea. He is 17, but looks 12 – a physical toll exacted by years of under-nourishment and hardship that two years ago prompted his escape, alone and under cover of darkness, from the country of his birth: North Korea. Kim and the 200 other pupils at Hangyeore middle and high school, an imposing $7.4m building in lush forests 80 kilometres south of Seoul, personify the cold war chasm that has consigned the two Koreas to a bitter estrangement that shows no sign of ending. The pupils arrive traumatised by their flight from the North and, in many cases, separation from their families. As the Guardian learned during a recent visit, they hope to leave equipped with the academic and social skills they need to prosper in a country dramatically different from the one they left behind. Today marks the 60th anniversary of the start of what has come to be known as the war that never ended. After three years of fighting, in which as many as four million people died, the two sides agreed on 27 July 1953 to a shaky truce, though no treaty was ever signed. It is maintained by forces either side of the demilitarized zone [DMZ], the world's most heavily fortified border. In the intervening years they have taken wildly divergent economic and social paths. The North, the world's only communist dynasty, remains desperately poor. Last year its per capita income was 1.2m won, 5% of its neighbour's, as it paid the price for international sanctions, deteriorating trade ties with the South and mismanagement of its command economy. South Korea, a robust democracy since 1987, has embraced the free market and grown to become the world's 15th-largest economy, a leader in consumer electronics and home to the fastest internet connections on the planet. Occasionally, hopes rise for a breakthrough that will pave the way to friendlier ties and eventual reunification, only to be dashed by isolated skirmishes, the arrival of hardline administrations in Seoul and the perennial unpredictability of a Pyongyang regime, led by Kim Jong-il, determined to turn itself into a nuclear power. As both sides prepared to mark the day communist forces poured over the border, mounting tensions on the peninsula fuelled talk of a second Korean war. Bilateral relations are at their lowest point in years following the March sinking of a South Korean warship, in which 46 sailors died, by a torpedo fired, according to international investigators, by a North Korean submarine. But experts dismiss the fear that the two countries are moving inexorably towards war. \"North Korea's provocations will continue as long as it continues to resist international pressure to denuclearise,\" says Kim Sung-han, a professor of international relations at Korea University in Seoul. \"But there is a very low probability that a full-scale war will break out …due to the superior military capability of South Korea and the US.\" For Kim Yong-hee, the current crisis is a timely reminder of the country in which he spent his first 15 years, and of why he decided to embark on a journey that so many others have tried and failed. He says he was taken to the border by a go-between, who bribed a North Korean guard to take the teenager across the Tumen River into northeast China. \"At one point the water came up to my neck,\" he said. Like many North Korean defectors, he took a circuitous route to freedom, a week in China and three months in detention in Thailand, from where he was deported to South Korea. He is desperate to be reunited with his mother, who escaped to the South a decade ago, but whom he hasn't seen since starting at Hangyeore. Two years after his escape, Kim is enjoying the education and freedoms denied to him in North Korea, where his schooling stopped at age 11. \"I was never allowed to do any sports there,\" he says, \"but now I play table tennis and badminton, and practice taekwondo. \"I like living here because it's wealthy and I can do more or less what I like, but I miss my parents.\" The government-funded school opened in 2006 for youths among the 20,000 defectors in South Korea. Many of Kim's peers, who are aged 13-24, arrived with just one or no parents and bore scars of a childhood spent in one of the world's poorest and most repressive countries. Most had witnessed public executions and seen members of their family die of starvation, and some still require regular counselling. \"There are such big differences that they find it hard to take in at first,\" says the school's principal, Gwak Jong-moon. \"Some had never seen a mobile phone, and they are not accustomed to thinking for themselves and competing academically.\" He smiles when asked to explain the differences in education either side of the DMZ. \"The contrast is huge. In North Korea students are indoctrinated, taught to worship Kim Jong-il and [the country's founder] Kim Il-sung. They are disappointed to learn that they had been lied to. They're angry, but it helps them let go of old ideas.\" And what of the South Korean version of modern history? \"They knew about the Korean war, but the North version is very different,\" Gwak said. \"They were told the invasion was a pre-emptive strike against US plans to destroy the North. We teach them that our involvement was an act of defence to contain the spread of Soviet communism.\" Despite government help, defectors of working age earn well below the average wage, and almost a fifth are in debt due to a combination of poor education and discrimination among employers. But the prospect of struggling to find work pales in comparison to the life Yi Gil-dong believes she could have expected to endure in North Korea. In the winter of 2007 she crossed a partially frozen Tumen River on the back of a bribed North Korean border guard, having been inspired to flee by a rare glimpse of a South Korean television drama. \"All I could think about was my parents,\" says the 21-year-old. \"I left while they were away on a trip and left I knew that they would be worried sick.\" Yi spent almost two years in China, most of it as a waitress at a Korean restaurant in Chengdu, from where she managed to contact her parents to tell them she was safe. She hasn't spoken to them since. She says she has few fond memories of her previous life, aside from her mother's cooking and the fresh air of her rural upbringing. \"I wasn't even allowed to wear the shoes I wanted. I went to school until I was 17 and, like the other students, I pretended to believe the propaganda we were taught at school. But we knew the difference between being free and not being free. \"It feels natural for me to be here, like this is where I am supposed to be.\" Given her youth, Yi may live long enough to realize her dream of counselling North Koreans in a newly united nation. But older defectors say they have witnessed too many false dawns to believe that unification is a realistic prospect. \"When I see the way Kim Jong-il is behaving, I don't think unification will come anytime soon,\" says Kim Young-chul, a former workers' party activist who fled North Korea six years ago, aged 82. Yet like most of his adopted country's 49 million people - 10 million of whom were separated from relatives by the war - he refuses to lose hope. \"After unification I will bring my sons, daughters and grandchildren here so they can see for themselves what freedom is really like.\" If that day does ever arrive, Gwak has high hopes for his pupils. \"I want them to become leaders in their field and play an active part in the movement for peace and freedom. \"We are the last truly divided nation in the world and, after unification, it will be up to young people like them to heal the wounds history has inflicted on us.\" The names of the defectors have been changed to protect their families The Korean war – a people divided The Korean war broke out at dawn on 25 June 1950 when almost a quarter of a million North Korean soldiers swept across the de facto border with South Korea, five years after the defeat of the peninsula's former occupier, Japan. The assault was a bold attempt to reunite the country, which had been spliced in two along the 38th parallel by the US and the Soviet Union at the end of the second world war. Sixty years later, the peninsula remains divided by a four-kilometre wide, 266km-long buffer zone – the world's most heavily fortified border – centred on the village of Panmunjom. To this day, almost two million troops, including 1.2 million from North Korea and 28,000 from the US, are engaged in a nervous standoff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jan/05/nuclear-energy-rising-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-05T16:22:07Z","webTitle":"Chris Goodall on the rising costs of UK nuclear energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/05/nuclear-energy-rising-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jan/05/nuclear-energy-rising-cost","fields":{"headline":"The rising costs of UK nuclear energy","bodyText":"The UK government's enthusiasm for the construction of nuclear power stations is based on a May 2007 consultation document published by the Department of Trade and Industry (now BERR). This paper argued that nuclear offered a financially viable way of generating electricity, broadly competitive with fossil fuels. It correctly pointed out that the cost of nuclear energy is largely determined by how much a plant costs to build, not by uranium prices or by the price of disposing of nuclear waste. Since the government's paper, nuclear power has suffered two huge blows. First, the pound has declined in value against the euro. This makes the core components of a nuclear power station more expensive as they are priced in the European currency. Second, the construction of the new nuclear power station in Finland has descended almost into farce as costs have ballooned and progress has slowed. The Finnish power station is much the more advanced of the two new nuclear plants currently under construction in Europe. If Finland is any guide, nuclear power is far more expensive than anybody expected. Taking these two points in reverse order: The Finnish debacle The French nuclear specialist Areva signed a fixed price contract with the Finnish consortium TVO. The value was about €3bn, in addition to the costs that TVO incurred readying the site for construction work and taking the plans through the Finnish approval processes. Areva has since taken several financial provisions in its accounts, reflecting the problems it has faced in completing the work to its initial budget. A provision is a way of recognising that a firm is going to make a future loss on a contract. So, for example, banks make provisions when it is apparent that a loan to a near-bankrupt company is unlikely ever to be repaid. Areva is largely owned by the French state, although some of its shares are held by investment institutions and others. In the Anglo-Saxon world, having private shareholders would oblige the company to state the absolute size of these provisions. In France it is different and Areva has consistently refused to state their actual size. But the French press recently offered the opinion that total provisions may now be €1.5bn, suggesting that Areva thinks that the total cost of fulfilling the contract is already €4.5bn, a rise of 50% on the initial price. This will not be the end of the matter. Areva has recently indicated that the final completion date of the plant will be sometime in 2012, making the station over three years late. Any further construction problems will raise the total eventual cost yet further. Late December 2008 saw a flurry of comment from Areva and its customer. Areva has accused TVO of failing to expedite some of the crucial technical approvals. In particular it seems to be saying (if I understand the French correctly) that TVO has failed to pass requests for safety clearance on to the Finnish nuclear regulator). TVO has denied this, but Areva has nevertheless asked for the formal appointment of an arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide whether TVO should bear some portion of the cost of the construction overruns. Areva's language is increasingly unbusiness-like. It now says that: 'seul un changement majeur du mode de fonctionnement de TVO permettra de figer un calendrier de projet'. (Roughly translated – 'only a major change in the way that TVO works will allow a solidification of the timetable of the project'.) In other words, even the 2012 completion date will not be achieved if the current poisonous relationship between Areva and TVO persists. So it is not unreasonable to expect that the current €4.5bn cost will rise still further, perhaps by billions of Euros. But let's be optimistic for once and say that the total construction cost of this plant will be €5.2bn including the initial design work, the groundworks and all the other costs borne by TVO and not Areva. This figure breaches the highest of all the cost estimates produced in the UK government consultation paper. (The DTI described the degree of prudence in its high case as 'extreme'. This turns out to be wrong.) The value of the euro If the Finnish construction costs were replicated in the UK, and the euro/pound exchange rate had remained at around £1/€1.50, the cost of the project would imply a cost to generate electricity of over £50 per megawatt hour. This is more than the current wholesale price in the UK (although the wholesale price has been much higher than this figure for most of the last 12 months). In the last days of 2008, the pound/euro exchange rate has hovered around 1.03. At the time of the 2007 consultation paper, the government used a figure of almost €1.50/£1. This change has added over 40% to the cost of constructing a new power station. Expressed in terms of UK pounds, the €5.2bn prospective cost of the Finnish power station now implies a price in UK£ of about £5bn rather than about £3.5bn. This raises the prospective cost of electricity generated by the nuclear power station to around £70 per megawatt hour, or over £20 more than the current wholesale price. To be clear, at today's electricity prices and exchange rates the operator of a nuclear power station built for the same price as the Finnish plant would lose £20 per megawatt hour. No rational electricity company intent on making a profit would contemplate making an investment in a nuclear station if these conditions persist. The UK government Climate Change Committee issued a long report in December 2008 on how Britain might reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% between 1990 and 2050. Nuclear forms an important part of these plans. Unsurprisingly, the Committee used a nuclear cost estimate of less than £50 per megawatt hour. The bad news from Finland is only slowly leaking out and, of course, the pound/euro rate changes sharply from day to day. The net impact of these two changes At the time of the 2007 government report, the potential operators of UK nuclear power stations estimated that the costs of running a plant would be less than £30 per megawatt hour, or considerably les than half the costs they are now likely to experience. Those electricity companies who so enthusiastically promoted nuclear power to the UK government would now be unable to make money at today's power prices. In fact, they would lose hundreds of millions of pounds a year at each power station that they opened. So will the nuclear ambitions die? We don't know. The companies could invest in the expectation that power prices will rise substantially over the next few years. Or they could assume that the pound/euro exchange rate will revert to about €1.50/£1. Both are risky assumptions when considering a £5bn bet. Unless the construction of new stations is guaranteed by the UK state, nuclear construction will not take place in the UK at Finnish prices or current exchange rates. It would even be cheaper to build coal-fired power stations with carbon capture and storage. The fall in the value of the pound also adversely affects the price of not just nuclear but also of other power generation technologies tied to the euro. Wind turbine prices, for example, have risen in price. The change in the exchange rate will hold back the development of many different types of low-carbon technologies. On the other hand, it provides an added incentive for electricity generation from tidal or wave generators, whose costs are partly denominated in pounds rather than euros. • This article was shared by our content partner Carbon Commentary, part of the Guardian Environment Network"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/jun/26/lindsey-oil-dispute-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-26T11:06:15Z","webTitle":"Deal agreed to end Lindsey oil refinery dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/26/lindsey-oil-dispute-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jun/26/lindsey-oil-dispute-deal","fields":{"headline":"Deal ends Lindsey oil refinery dispute","bodyText":"A deal has been hammered out to end the Lindsey oil dispute that has sparked sympathy industrial action around Britain. The agreement was reached last night between the unions and contractors at the site, owned by French company Total. Talks continued until 11.30pm. The proposal will be examined by shop stewards at Lindsey today and put to a workers' vote on Monday. Full details of the deal that could end the unofficial walkout that began two weeks ago have not been announced. Union sources say it includes a commitment that the 51 staff who were made redundant would now return to work at the site. The 647 construction workers who were fired by Total for walking out in support will also be reinstated. \"We understand that the contractors and the unions reached a deal last night,\" said a spokeswoman for Total, who were not represented at the talks. \"We hope that the workers will be back on site as soon as possible, and that construction work will be completed on time.\" The GMB and Unite unions are recommending that their members support the deal. The dispute began on 10 June when 51 staff were laid off at the site, even though people were being hired for other jobs helping to construct the hydro desulphurisation plant. It spread to other sites across Britain, including the Sellafield nuclear power station, after the 647 workers were fired for taking part in the unofficial action. Staff at Sellafield and at the Longannet power station in Fife, where 150 staff walked out, returned to work today following news of the Lindsey deal. In January, more than 1,000 Lindsey staff went on strike in a row over the use of overseas workers at the plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/nov/27/nuclear-reactors-contain-safety-flaws","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-27T00:05:05Z","webTitle":"Nuclear reactors contain safety flaws, watchdog reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/27/nuclear-reactors-contain-safety-flaws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/nov/27/nuclear-reactors-contain-safety-flaws","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear reactors contain safety flaws, watchdog reveals","bodyText":"In the race to provide energy for the nation's future, two multinational companies have led the way with designs for reactors that promised clean, green electricity with unprecedented safety. But detailed reviews by the Health and Safety Executive highlight a series of shortcomings in security and safety systems in both reactors that must be fixed or redesigned before the power plants can be approved for construction. Safety officials reviewed plans from the European companies, Areva and EDF, which make the EPR reactor, and similar documents for the AP1000 reactor built by the American multinational power company, Westinghouse, and ruled that both need to improve the safety of their power plants before they can be approved for construction. British Ministers are thought to favour the European reactor design, two of which are under construction in Finland and France. The review identified a flaw that involved a protection system being wired up the wrong way. The safety of the reactor relies on an electronic protection system that should be independent of the power station's computerised control circuit. In the case of an accident, the protection system takes over and brings the plant under control. The initial designs for the plant showed the two systems were interconnected, raising fears that a fault on one could disable the other. Kevin Allars, head of the assessment team at the HSE's nuclear directorate said: \"You could have the same fault occurring on both, so your protection system won't do what it's supposed to do. The company has proposed a way to fix the problem, but has yet to provide details.\" The HSE's assessment of the reactor was delayed for months because staff with the correct security clearance were not on hand to exchange sensitive security documents on making the reactors strong enough to withstand a direct hit from an aeroplane. The reactors are required to be resilient to aircraft strikes, instrument failures and natural hazards, such as floods, fires, extreme winds and earthquakes. The review was further hampered because the reactor was designed to French or European safety codes, which differ from those used by the Health and Safety Executive. More problems were raised over the double steel-lined concrete shells that encase the nuclear reactor and prevent radioactive material escaping if the reactor core goes into meltdown. In all other British nuclear power stations, the concrete is strengthened by steel cables that can be inspected and removed as the reactor ages, but in the European design, the cables are grouted over, making maintenance checks impossible. Other criticisms included problems with the positioning and operation of fire doors and alarms, and unsubstantiated claims that components are unlikely to break while the reactor is running. The issues will have to be addressed before the executive will approve the reactor, Allars said. The report adds: \"We have yet to see the design modifications details and so it is not yet possible for us to conclude on the acceptability of them. For the other issues we have raised, it is too early to say whether they can be resolved solely with additional safety case changes or whether they may result in design modifications being necessary.\" The review of the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor is more damning, concluding that Westinghouse needs to complete \"significant additional work\" to prove its reactor is safe across \"the majority of the technical topic areas\". The HSE said its officials have been unable to complete their review of the reactor because Westinghouse failed to provide details of the power plant's ability to withstand environmental hazards and potential terrorist attacks. The company's assertions that workers and others could not put the reactor at risk were also poorly documented, according to the executive, which has asked Westinghouse for more information. A major criticism of the US design concerns a new type of valve that has yet to be developed, but plays a critical role in cooling the core of the reactor if it runs out of control. The report said that despite it raising the issue with Westinghouse, the company has made \"minimal progress in addressing our concerns\". It adds: \"There is a significant risk that the depth of the issue and the resources and effort that are needed to address it have been underestimated.\" The HSE review questions the design standards used to plan the reactor and the durability of individual components, which Westinghouse claims are so unlikely to fail the possibility can be discounted. It adds that Westinghouse may still be able to satisfy the HSE's concerns, but needs to make major progress if the reactor review is to be completed by 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2010/oct/18/politics-live-blog-monday","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-18T07:58:27Z","webTitle":"Politics live blog  - Monday 18 October","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/oct/18/politics-live-blog-monday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2010/oct/18/politics-live-blog-monday","fields":{"headline":"Politics live blog  - Monday 18 October","bodyText":"8.09am: It's the week of the spending review and today, as part of the build-up for Wednesday's mega-announcement, we've got two big political events. 11am: Alan Johnson, Labour's new shadow chancellor, will deliver a speech on Labour's economic strategy. It will be the first policy statement of any significance to come from the party since Ed Miliband became leader. Toby Helm and Anushka Asthana gave us a preview of what Johnson will say in the Observer yesterday - Johnson will say the banks should contribute towards a £7bn \"push for growth\" - but only a few sentences from the speech have actually been released in advance. 3.30pm: David Cameron will release a written statement about the government's national security strategy. As Richard Norton-Taylor writes in the Guardian today, the document will argue that \"while a serious threat remains from terrorism, the threat of cyber attacks from jihadist groups and foreign states is growing\". The strategy will provide the backdrop for the strategic defence and security review that is being published tomorrow. There's quite a lot of other stuff around too. Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, is making a statement about energy policy that is expected to say the government won't fund the Severn barrage. The three Labour MPs accused of fiddling their expenses are making their case that the criminal courts should not have jurisdiction over the case at the supreme court today. And, at 3.15pm, the House of Lords privileges committee will publish reports into claims that Lady Uddin, Lord Paul and Lord Bhatia - all Labour peers - have abused their expenses. I'll be covering all the breaking news, as well as taking a look at what's in the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. 9.12am: Theresa May, the home secretary, has been doing the rounds of the broadcasting studios this morning talking about the national security strategy. From what I've seen on PoliticsHome (which has been monitoring her interviews), she doesn't seem to have said anything particularly revealing. But here are some highlights anyway. • She confirmed that cyber-attacks are a growing threat. \"Cyber security is a growing threat; it's a threat to government, it's a threat to business and it's a threat to personal security,\" she said. • She said that the police could cut spending without frontline services being affected. \"On policing, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary came up with a report which found that 12% could come out of policing without affecting frontline policing,\" she said. • She suggested the national security strategy was the first of its kind. \"It's the first time the government has brought together all aspects of security. It looks at how we deal with all threats, including threats such as floods,\" she said. 9.33am: Theresa May suggested that the national security strategy being published today was the first of its kind, but it was actually Gordon Brown who began the practice of publishing an annual national security strategy. He first published on in 2008. Here's the national security strategy for 2009 (the most recent). 9.36am: The national security strategy isn't even out yet, but Yvette Cooper, the shadow foreign secretary, has taken a swipe at it. She's issued this statement. The government seem to be producing a reheated security strategy to provide cover for a rushed defence spending review, rather than producing a renewed and careful consideration of the UK's defence and security priorities. The government should show renewed vigour in the process towards a political settlement in Afghanistan, led by the Afghans, while supporting our 10,000 troops with the resources they need in creating the conditions on the ground for a more stable country. 10.18am: Government has \"all but lost the capacity to think strategically\", according to the Commons public administration committee. It makes the point in a report out today called \"Who does UK National Strategy?\" If we now have a renewed need for national strategy, we have all but lost the capacity to think strategically. We have simply fallen out of the habit, and have lost the culture of strategy-making. The new government's aspiration to think strategically is most welcome but to restore strategic leadership ministers must invest time and energy into this. It is the only way to stimulate demand for strategic analysis and assessment within government. It must be supported by the establishment of specific mechanisms with appropriate authority. Bernard Jenkin, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, has been giving interviews this morning explaining what this means. According to PoliticsHome (paywall), here's an extract. Strategic thinking in Whitehall has been very downgraded ... William Hague has been making speeches, very ambitious speeches, about expanding Britain's influence. Unfortunately there is no capacity in Whitehall to make what he says in that speech happen and get moving at 9am the next day. 10.36am: Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, has confirmed that the government will not fund the Severn barrage. (See 8.09am.) This is what he has just said. The study [published today into the Severn barrage project] clearly shows that there is no strategic case at this time for public funding of a scheme to generate energy in the Severn estuary. Other low carbon options represent a better deal for taxpayers and consumers. Huhne made the announcement as he published a written ministerial statement covering various aspects of energy policy. He has also confirmed eight sites as potentially suitable for new nuclear power stations by 2005: Bradwell, Essex; Hartlepool, Borough of Hartlepool; Heysham, Lancashire; Hinkley Point, Somerset; Oldbury, South Glos.; Sellafield, Cumbria; Sizewell, Suffolk; Wylfa, Isle of Anglesey. 10.54am: You can find all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here are the political stories and articles that I found most interesting. • Andrew Porter and Robert Winnett in the Daily Telegraph say 35 leading business leaders have written a letter to the paper urging the government not to water down its programme of spending cuts. In today's letter, the business leaders write: \"Everyone knows that when you have a debt problem, delaying the necessary action will make it worse not better. The cost of delay is enormous, and would result in almost £100 billion of additional national debt by the end of this Parliament alone.\" • Mary Ann Sieghart in the Independent says that politics has become civilised and that all three main parties are led by men \"who are, at heart, really rather nice\". Douglas Alexander, who spent many years in the Brown camp before ending up as David's campaign manager, has been telling friends recently how wonderful it was to be working for someone who simply wouldn't allow negative briefing. • George Parker and Chris Giles in the Financial Times (subscription) say George Osborne is planning further big cuts in welfare \"as part of an audacious drive to prove that the coalition can match Labour's pre-election pledge to protect key frontline services\". Mr Osborne refused to rule out scrapping child benefit for people aged 16-19. Other options include freezing non-pension benefits, means-testing incapacity benefit, raising pension contributions for state employees and changing eligibility for tax credits. Those measures could raise £9bn-£10bn collectively. • James Blitz in the Financial Times (subscription) says Britain will double the amount of aid it spends alleviating poverty in areas of conflict. [David] Cameron will say [on Tuesday] Britain currently spends £2bn relieving poverty in nations plagued by conflict, such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. This will be doubled to £4bn by 2015. • David Laws has co-written an article in the Financial Times (subscription) saying the government should ensure that the schools that get extra money from the pupil premium actually use it to help poorer pupils. Those schools that fail to deliver better outcomes – those who spend their pupil premium money in ways that do not improve pupil performance – should expect government to take a much closer interest in their affairs. Such schools should be supported, perhaps even required, to use tried and tested pedagogical techniques in return for further additional investment. • The Times (paywall) says commuters face \"a rise in train fares over the next four years of more than 30 per cent\" as a results of cuts in the spending review. • John Redwood in the Times (paywall) says that public spending will actually go up during this parliament. So why do we hear so much about \"cuts\" in current spending? In part it reflects the traditional distorted debate in the UK about public expenditure. Between 1979 and 1997 we heard endlessly about cuts in public spending from Labour and its allies in the public sector unions. Over that long time period public spending rose every year in cash terms, and it rose by more than the cost increases every year apart from 1988-9. • David Oakley and George Parker in the Financial Times (subscription) say that investors have warned the government not to delay public spending cuts. \"In a survey of eight of the world's biggest government bond investors, which hold about £200bn in gilts, a majority urges the government to stick to its tough fiscal plans,\" the FT says. 11.15am: Alan Johnson is delivering his speech now. He's at KPMG's offices in London. At the Conservative conference, the Tories tried to make the point that Labour had no economic policy by giving out blank notebooks with \"Ed Miliband's detailed plan for reducing the deficit\" on the cover. Today Johnson is addressing that charge directly, and insisting that Labour does have a credible alternative. 11.26am: Johnson has finished his speech. He's not taking questions. I'm just reading it now and will post on it shortly. 12.46pm: The Tories are going to have to get rid of their joke notebooks. (See 11.15am.) Labour now does have a position on the deficit. It's similar to the one it had before the election, but with higher taxes for banks and more emphasis on growth. It might not be the most detailed economic plan ever put forward by an opposition party, but it will allow Labour now to argue that there is an alternative to what is being proposed by George Osborne on Wednesday. Here are the key points from Alan Johnson's speech. The full text is now on Labour's website. • Johnson called for banks to be taxed an extra £3.5bn a year by the end of this parliament. Aides suggested the money could come from extending the tax on bank bonuses (which was introduced by Alistair Darling as a one-off and which raised far more than expected), or from setting the bank levy at a level higher than the £2.4bn planned by the coalition, or from a mixture of the two. Johnson said the money would contribute to \"a fund to prioritise growth\" worth £7.5bn by 2014-15, with the money going on infrastructure projects. Aides explained that Johnson wanted taxation to raise £7.5bn more than Labour planned when it was in power, but £4bn of the extra money came from taxes introduced by the coalition since May (the bank levy, capital gains tax and the freezing of allowances for higher-rate taxpayers). Labour is only proposing an extra £3.5bn a year on top of that. • Johnson said he was not proposing further increases in personal taxation. \"We are not proposing to halve the deficit with increases in personal taxation beyond those already announced,\" he said. This is significant. In an interview with Labour Uncut last week, Peter Hain, one of Ed Miliband's key supporters, suggested that taxes should go up for high earners. • Johnson backed Darling's timetable for tackling the deficit. \"Ed Miliband and I are clear: in the current economic circumstances, halving borrowing over four years is right,\" he said. \"It is the balanced approach.\" During Labour's leadership election Miliband said that halving the deficit over four years – the policy set by Darling before the election – should be seen as a \"starting point\", suggesting that the Labour leader might have been in favour of bringing the deficit down more slowly. Today Johnson has ruled that out. But Johnson did say that tax increases should play a greater role in cutting the deficit than under Darling's plans (which is why Johnson advocated the £3.5bn taxes on banks – see above). • Johnson said departmental budgets would be cut by an average of 8% under Labour's plans. He produced that figure by taking into account the extra taxes he proposed (see above). Cuts on that scale would be about half the 14% cuts set out in the emergency budget. That was equivalent to a £27bn difference in the amount that would be cut from public spending by 2014-15 • He accused the government of spreading three \"myths\" about the spending cuts. They were: that the deficit was avoidable, that there was no alternative to fast and deep cuts, and that cuts were progressive. All three were false, he claimed. • He accused the government of taking a \"reckless gamble\" with the economy. The government's cuts could slow growth, he suggested. But he did not predict a double-dip recession. • He said Labour would oppose the government's plan to uprate some benefits in line with the consumer price index and not the retail price index. \"Making a permanent change, with its impact being felt even after the deficit is long gone, is an ideologically driven move that we will oppose,\" Johnson said. \"If the government were to propose a time-limited change, ensuring that benefits did not fall behind earnings in the next few years, we would consider whether that was a fairer alternative to deep cuts in departmental expenditure.\" Uprating benefits in line with CPI saves the government £6bn by the end of this parliament. • He said Labour would not oppose every cut. Labour would support welfare reforms that are fair, proportionate and encourage work, he said. • He said Labour would not publish \"a shadow spending review\". 1.29pm: Adult social care will get an extra £2bn in the spending review, according to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. 1.29pm: William Hague won't be giving a statement in the Commons this afternoon about the national security strategy, contrary to what I was told by officials earlier. Instead the document will just be published alongside a written statement from David Cameron. 1.33pm: Here's a lunchtime summary: • Alan Johnson, the shadow chancellor, has set out Labour's alternative to the government's spending cuts. \"We need a tough approach to tackling the deficit, but one that is flexible enough to react to changing economic circumstances,\" Johnson said. Labour would cut spending more slowly than the government and raise an extra £3.5bn from the banks, using the money to fund infrastructure projects, he said. He also said he was not in favour of any increases in personal taxation above those already announced by the government and backed Alistair Darling's plan for the deficit to be halved over four years. (See 12.46pm.) • Labour has criticised the national security strategy ahead of its publication this afternoon. Yvette Cooper, the shadow foreign secretary, said it seemed to be \"a reheated security strategy to provide cover for a rushed defence spending review\". The cabinet has been meeting to discuss the strategic defence and security review. The review will be published tomorrow, and it will reflect the priorities outlined in today's national security strategy. (See 9.36am.) • Britain's most senior police officer has told his officers that they must \"deliver better policing for less\". In a message to staff ahead of the spending review, Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said: \"At present, I cannot predict how many jobs we might lose as we shrink, but what I can promise though, is that we will strip out any waste, duplication and unnecessary spending and take advantage of every possible saving, as we move forward. We need to deliver better policing for less at every level – from neighbourhood patrols through to international counterterrorist work. That must be our aim.\" • Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, has said the government will not fund plans to build a 10-mile barrage across the Severn estuary to generate electricity from tides. In an announcement on energy strategy, he also said he would approve the building of new nuclear power plants at eight sites. (See 10.36am.) • The supreme court has been told that parliament, not the criminal courts, should deal with complaints about MPs abusing their expenses. Nigel Pleming, the QC representing two of the three former Labour MPs accused of fiddling their expenses, said the men were protected by parliamentary privilege. \"So far as we are aware these are the first criminal prosecutions of members of the House of Commons in relation either to a statement made in or to parliament or its delegates, or based on a member's dealings with parliament, for over 300 years,\" Pleming told the supreme court this morning. The court will have to decide whether the three former Labour MPs – who deny the charges – will face criminal trial. 2.16pm: On the World at One Alan Johnson said that the plans he set out in his speech suggested that 60:40 should be the ratio of spending cuts to tax increases used to tackle the deficit. As Paul Waugh points out on his blog, Ed Miliband hinted during the Labour leadership election that he was in favour of moving towards a 50:50 ratio. Johnson said 60:40 was \"about the right balance\". He went on: \"We are being very, very clear here, we are not looking at people's personal taxation.\" Johnson also said the letter in the Daily Telegraph from business leaders backing the government's approach to cutting the deficit (see 10.54am) was \"a bit sad\". He explained: We are in a week of lots of what used to be called spin when we were in power - but nobody seems to use that anymore - that the government is getting its daily message across to try and alleviate what's coming on Wednesday. Part of that is a Conservative supporter who organised this letter. It's politically-motivated from Conservative Central Office. On his BBC blog Robert Peston says that some of the people who signed the letter, such as Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, Paul Walsh of Diageo and Ian Cheshire of Kingfisher, are seen in the City as Tory supporters. But at least one of them, Carphone Warehouse's Charles Dunstone, was a supporter of New Labour, Peston says. 2.34pm: YouGov has released what it describes as its first poll on the London mayoral race for 2012. On first preferences, Boris Johnson is only narrowly ahead of Ken Livingstone (46% to 44%). On a forced choice, Johnson beats Livingstone by 46% to 41%. 2.43pm: At the weekend there were reports about Iain Duncan Smith's plans for crackdown on benefit fraud. These focused on his plans for a \"three strikes and you're out rule\" designed to remove benefits completely from repeat offenders, even though the department for work and pensions subsequently had to admit that only six people have been convicted of benefit fraud three times since 2002. Today a report setting out the strategy in detail has been released. This shows that the government is going to adopt a more aggressive approach to recovering money fraudulently claimed. In some circumstances, debtors could be forced to sell their homes, it says. (See paragraph 23.) We will also introduce more stringent mechanisms for rapidly and effectively recovering our debts. Both DWP and HMRC will look to increase the maximum rate at which we fraud debts can be recovered by deduction from benefits by around 25%. DWP will also look to widen the range of debts which we can recover from, and introduce a fast track system for requiring money to be deducted from an employee's earnings, known as Direct Earnings Attachment. Alongside this, DWP will make further use of data-matching to enable us to recover assets from those who have the ability to pay, but persistently refuse todo so. This will include, in the last resort, forcing debtors to sell their houses. The press notice about the new fraud and error strategy is here. 3.00pm: Michael Fallon, the Conservative party's deputy chairman, has put out a statement criticising Alan Johnson's deficit reduction plans. Labour's black hole just got bigger, not smaller. Ed Miliband promised a plan to close the deficit. All we got today was yet more spending proposals and a tax on banks that would need international agreement and wouldn't tackle the deficit. In their notes to his press release, the Tories said that Johnson suggested that a new bank tax would have to be agreed internationally when he appeared on the Andrew Marr show yesterday. Johnson told Marr: \"Now you have to try and do this internationally and that's what Alistair Darling, it was his idea to have a banking levy, but, er, er to ensure that this happens across the world as well so you need to do that.\" (Bizarrely, the Tories also criticised Johnson for misspelling \"quantitative\" in the text of his speech. Johnson spelt it \"quantative\". I'm all in favour of proper spelling, but this seems a bit petty.) 3.20pm: Three peers are being suspended from the the House of Lords for abusing their expenses, it has just been announced. My colleague Polly Curtis has sent me the details. Three peers were today suspended from Parliament in the toughest punishment enacted in the house of Lords in modern times after an inquiry found that each had broken expenses rules to wrongly claim tens of thousands of pounds in expenses. Lady Uddin, Lord Paul and Lord Bhatia face suspension from the house for varying terms and have been ordered to pay back £125,000, £40,000 and £27,000 respectively. Only two other peers have ever been suspended before and the penalties are the most stringent ever imposed. There will be a vote on Thursday, which is expected to ratify the sanctions. All three peers were accused of naming properties outside London that they hardly visited as their primary residence in order to designate their London homes as their second property and maximise their expenses. Each had broken rules to claim the £174 a night allowance for accommodation when they in fact lived within a few miles of Westminster. Uddin and Bhatia were judged to have purposely broken the rules while Paul breached the rules demonstrating \"gross irresponsibility and negligence\" but did not act in bad faith. Uddin and Paul are Labour peers; Bhatia is a crossbencher. 3.26pm: Here's more detail from my colleague Polly Curtis from the privileges committee reports into the three peers. (See 3.20pm.) • Uddin first claimed her brother's flat, then a flat she owned in Kent, as her first home when in fact she rarely stayed away from her main home four miles from central London. The committee rejected Uddin's argument that the two flats had been \"bolt-holes\" during a troubled period in her marriage, saying a bolt-hole did not constitute a main home. It allowed her to claim£125,349.10 in overnight and travel allowances. She faces an 18 month suspension which was reduced from three years on appeal. • Paul, 115th on the Sunday Times rich list, claimed for expenses purposes that his primary residence was a flat in a hotel he owned to claim overnight expenses. He \"freely\" admitted he had never spent a night there. The report said: \"We do not feel justified in finding, on the balance of probabilities that Lord Paul acted dishonestly or in bad faith. However his actions were utterly unreasonable, and demonstrated gross irresponsibility and negligence.\" Paul faces a four months suspension and has already repaid £41,982. • Bhatia has lived in a £1.5m family home in Hampton, southwest London for 20 years, but from 2007 claimed his primary residence was a two-bedroom flat in Reigate, Surrey. Bhatia faces an eight month suspension and has already repaid £27,446. 3.35pm: Michael Gove is answering questions about the \"fairness premium\" in the Commons now. He is responding to an emergency question tabled by Andy Burnham, the shadow education secretary. Gove has just said that school spending will go up in real terms under the terms of the spending review. 3.46pm: The three Lords privileges committee reports into Uddin, Paul and Bhatia are available here. 3.49pm: Lord Paul has been speaking about the investigation into his expenses and his suspension from the House of Lords. First and foremost, my honesty and integrity have been upheld. I have never tried to claim anything which I did not believe I was honestly entitled to claim at the time. I am pleased that the Committee for Privileges and Conduct has come to the same conclusion and has found that my actions throughout the investigation have been transparent and consistent and that the claims were honestly made and not in bad faith ... I do not believe that either the sub-committee or the full committee can in effect apply the perspectives and standards of 2010 to actions and rules operating in 2005. I believe that the provisions which applied then on the designation of principal residence were wholly unclear. I believe that the fact that they have been either amplified or modified since then, and finally dispensed with by the House, strongly underlines my position. Mehdi Hasan has got more on his New Statesman blog, where Hasan also points out some discrepancies in the way the Lords rules are enforced. 3.56pm: The national security strategy is out. You can read the 39-page document here, and the Number 10 press notice about it here. My colleague Nicholas Watt has had the chance to read it in full. As he explains on his blog, he's not impressed. When governments release documents written in gibberish they are usually hiding something. When that gibberish covers the nation's security it is time to sit up. The 38-page national security strategy, released to parliament this afternoon by William Hague, is written up in the sort of vacuous, windy language that will horrify the older generation of diplomats who pride themselves on their command of English. Take this gem on page 25: Most national security threats arise from actions by others: states or non-state actors, who are hostile to our interests. That is what is known technically as a statement of the bleedin' obvious. 4.02pm: Here's an afternoon reading list. • Iain Martin at the Wall Street Journal says Ed Miliband doesn't have to decide whether or not to attend the TUC's anti-cuts rally tomorrow, because the TUC has decided that politicians aren't invited. • Jim Pickard at the FT's Westminster blog says the fact that Alan Johnson did not take questions after delivering his speech this morning \"made it look as if the MP (who is not exactly an ingenue, having held five cabinet posts) could not be trusted by his handlers to veer off-script\". • Siôn Simon at Labour Uncut says \"if Ed [Miliband] is to have a chance of electoral success, he needs Labour's right-wing tradition to be articulated\". The compass-lite new tribunism which has set the tone so far cannot win elections. To believe it can is somewhere between naïve and perverse. You can write as many pamphlets as you like about new-sharingism or whatever this week's cloak is called, but the British people have not voted for an underlyingly anti-capitalist programme for 65 years and they never will again. 4.18pm: Here's an afternoon summary: • Three peers face suspension from parliament for wrongly claiming expenses. Lady Uddin, Lord Paul and Lord Bhatia face suspension from the house for varying terms and have been ordered to pay back £125,000, £40,000 and £27,000 respectively. The punishments are the most severe ordered by the Lords in modern times. • Cyber attacks have been identified as one of the greatest threats facing Britain. Publishing the national security strategy, David Cameron said: \"Our objectives are ensuring a secure and resilient United Kingdom, and shaping a stable world. In pursuit of these goals, our highest priorities are tackling terrorism, cyber security, international military crises and natural disasters such as floods and pandemics. We will draw together and use all the instruments of national power to tackle these risks, including the armed forces, diplomats, intelligence and development professionals, the police, the private sector and the British people themselves.\" (See 3.56pm.) • Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, has released details of his plans to combat benefit fraud. \"We will use credit reference agencies and data matching techniques to spot the tell-tale patterns of fraud,\" said Lord Freud, the welfare minister. \"We will employ 200 more investigators and bring in a mobile taskforce to investigate each and every claim in high fraud areas. When people are convicted we will get back the money we are owed, introduce tough punishments and strip the assets of criminal gangs.\" Debtors could be forced to sell their homes if they do not repay money owed to the department for work and pensions. (See 2.43pm.) • Michael Gove, the education secretary, has said that school spending \"will rise in real terms\" under the spending review. He made the announcement as he explained how the government's £7bn \"fairness premium\" will work. (See 3.35pm.) That's it for today.

The same month brought confirmation of worse-than-expected upward trends in worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, and new research suggesting that the threat posed by even small rises in global mean temperature is greater than previously thought. The writing also seems to be on the wall, or rather in the fast-vanishing ice, for Spain's glaciers. Desperate times might seem to call for desperate measures. And there is a tendency is to make a grab for the first and apparently the easiest solution to come to hand. In this context, magic-bullet technological fixes are enjoying a renaissance. From nuclear power to GM crops, once-unpopular technologies are struggling anew for public acceptance. Some commentators associated with the green movement who were previously sceptical have voiced support, delighting some special interest groups but causing wider consternation. Because the timeframe for action on global warming is so short, the choices we make about where we put our efforts for action are vital. Take the wrong road and the risk is that there will not be a second chance. So, are those who remain sceptical dogmatic and ideological, while those whose positions shift, open minded and rational? Look, for example, at the issue of feeding a growing population in a warming world. For this reason alone, we are told, GM crops should be embraced. Yet recently, one of the most comprehensive scientific assessments yet undertaken on the future of farming globally, was profoundly ambiguous about the role and potential of GM crops. The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) was initiated by a combination of the World Bank and various UN bodies to do farming, health, the environment and development. Their set-up was roughly analogous to the IPCC's assessments on climate change. The GM industry itself was involved until the findings went against them and they withdrew. The assessment concluded that GM crops may sometimes have a role, but were in many cases unpromising and unproven. A separate UN report on farming in Africarecently found that, 'Simply applying the \"industrial\" agricultural models of the twentieth century into the twenty-first as a single, global solution will not serve us well.' It went on to say specifically that 'organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems, and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the long-term.' [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/ditcted200715_en.pdf] What about a rational case for nuclear power as an energy fix for global warming? One problem for the new found advocates is time scale. If begun today, over the next crucial eight years and possibly significantly longer, any newly commissioned nuclear generating capacity will make no contribution at all to emissions reductions. It could, however, inadvertently push emissions up by redirecting funds away from cheaper, more efficient and quicker to implement alternatives, such as energy efficiency, conservation and renewables. In one of a number of similar studies, the UK Sustainable Development Commission found that, even in the face of climate change, the nation's energy needs could be met without recourse to nuclear power. In addition, it made the point that nuclear energy came with serious unsolved problems to do with long-term waste, cost, inflexibility and international security. The British government's own original white paper on energy was similarly dismissive of nuclear power and enthusiastic about renewables. Several studies have highlighted the so-called \"voodoo economics\" of the nuclear industry. Even nuclear's recent track record with the latest technology has been, at best, unimpressive. A Finnish nuclear plant, for example, that in 2002 was the first for a decade to be commissioned in Europe, was meant to be finished in 2009 at a cost of €3.2 billion. It's currently €2.2 billion over budget and at least three years behind schedule. So there are clearly other reasons why the debate on tackling climate change so often becomes transfixed by magic bullet technologies. Partly it is the impact of highly effective special interest lobbying. But there is clearly something else, more psychological going on, that possibly has a parallel with party politics. In reaction to its years of electoral isolation, the Labour party ended up fiercely embracing and internalising the neo-liberal economic agenda it once rejected. With whole economies collapsing, it was a conversion that turned-out rather badly. Now, in a broadly comparable dynamic, some environmentalists are ditching their former analysis for faith in technologies that shine the brightest and shout the loudest. Where climate change is concerned, the absolute urgency of action makes it even more vital not that we just do anything, but that we do the right thing. 93 months and counting … • Each month Andrew Simms is analysing how much closer the world has moved to catastrophic climate change.

In the 2005 election this pairing won 35.2%. There have been four general elections in the elite group of the world's most powerful economies since the global financial crisis first erupted. Two of them, in the US and Japan, have produced decisive moves to the left in favour of change. The two others, in Canada and the weekend federal election in Germany, have produced much less radical outcomes, keeping competent centre-right governments in power. The most important feature of the German election result is that Angela Merkel's CDU-CSU has been returned to office in a new coalition with the liberal FDP. But the most striking aspect of Sunday's poll is that the two previously dominant parties have been cut down to size. Four years ago, the CDU-CSU took 40.8% of the vote and was forced into a centrist \"grand\" coalition with the centre-left SPD. This time, Mrs Merkel's vote fell to 33.8%. She has been helped in retaining power by the rise in the FDP vote, which went from 9.8% in 2005 to 14.6% today. This was the liberals' year. Their success means a narrow majority for tax cuts and renewed public service reforms, and for nuclear power; whether the new coalition will be able to put either policy into practice will be the key domestic test for Germany. Much of that will depend on what happens to the now seriously weakened and divided German left. It is 11 years since the SPD ousted Helmut Kohl and formed a majority coalition with the Greens. Now, however, the SPD's vote has hit its lowest-ever mark of 23% and the CDU-FDP coalition is back. (By coincidence, a ComRes poll in yesterday's Independent showed Labour on 23% in this country too; times are tough for social democrats in many parts of Europe.) The strength of the Left party, which polled 12% and gets its most concentrated support in the old East Germany, is a challenge to which the SPD has failed to respond. All in all, however, the two big parties which have headed every German government since the second world war are now down to less than 57% of the vote. All the minor parties polled strongly and increased their shares. For the first time in modern Germany, all the parties in the new Bundestag have polled more than 10% but less than 40%. Multi-party politics has never been more deeply entrenched in Germany than it is now. Germans have nevertheless rewarded Mrs Merkel for steering a coalition with the SPD through turbulent economic times, without presiding over economic disaster or abandoning popular social programmes. Germans have not voted for radical change. They have given a vote of confidence to their tried and tested social market model, but in a very different way from before. • This article was amended on 1 October 2009. The original said that the FDP took only 4.7% of the vote in 2005. It also said that the 2009 election result cut the two major parties down to size in an unprecedented way.

Barbara Boxer, chairman of the environment and public works committee, defied a Republican boycott to vote through a sweeping plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 20% over 2005 levels by 2020. Such a law is seen as vital for the ultimate success of a worldwide treaty to tackle global warming. Republicans had boycotted the bill drafting sessions, demanding a more time for the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a detailed analysis of how much the bill will cost the economy and ordinary consumers. Boxer defended her decision to go ahead with the vote despite the boycott. \"The committee and Senate rules that have been in place during Republican and Democratic majorities are there to be used when the majority feels it is in the best interest of their states and of the nation to act,\" she said in a statement. The EPA has done an extensive analysis of a climate change bill passed by the House of representatives in June, and Boxer said it would be uneconomical to order a new study of what are essentially very similar proposals. But Boxer's move angered Republicans as well as some moderate Democrats who have reservations about the bill. A powerful Democrat on her committee, Max Baucus of Montana, voted no today. making the final count 11-1. He said in a statement he was worried that the 20% target was too high and that he wanted more protection for agriculture. But he added: \"I'm going to work to get climate change legislation that can get 60 votes, get through the US Senate and signed into law.\" The bill's prospects are also threatened by twin defeats this week for Democrats in governors' elections in New Jersey and Virginia. Senators, especially those from coal producing and rust belt states who had earlier raised concerns that the climate bill could be a \"jobs killer\" are now much more likely to distance themselves from Barack Obama's agenda. \"The question is, do people think we're tending to the things they care about?\" John Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia who has been on the fence on climate change, told reporters. \"Don't think people in my state are going to stand up and start cheering about Copenhagen,\" Rockefeller said. Other Democratic senators - whose support for a climate change law had already been doubtful - said they would now have to think carefully about economic consequences of energy reform. \"People need to be saying slow it down and don't add more to the deficit,\" said Ben Nelson a Democrat from Nebraska. \"And what have many of us been talking about? We don't want to see anything added to the deficit unless there's cost containment.\" Boxer reportedly defied advice from the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, to give the Republicans until next Tuesday to end their boycott. She also disregarded four moderate Republican senators whose support is seen as critical to the bill's passage. The senators wrote to the EPA on Wednesday warning they could not support a bill without a detailed cost analysis from the agency. \"We have a keen interest in ensuring that cost estimates, models and other data critical to the legislative process be made available to members of Congress and the public in a timely manner,\" the four senators wrote. \"We cannot support legislation without this information.\" However, John Kerry who is leading an effort to craft a broader climate and energy bill that would allow offshore drilling and expand nuclear power, said the vote would not hurt prospects of action on global warming. \"This is and has always been a big lift,\" he said. Kerry said earlier that growing support for climate change legislation in the business community and the opportunities for different regions in the US would eventually overpower other arguments. He also said that the US chamber of commerce, which has been opposing the climate change bill, now seemed to be adopting a more nuanced position."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2007/may/25/energy.nuclearindustry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-25T14:45:45Z","webTitle":"Letters: Time and tide wait on nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/25/energy.nuclearindustry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/may/25/energy.nuclearindustry","fields":{"headline":"Time and tide wait on nuclear power","bodyText":"How can the government justify plans for a nuclear future (Report, May 24) when such plants will be unable to operate, without breaking environmental laws, if the climate-change crisis continues at the current rate? Nuclear power plants source enormous amounts of cool water from rivers and reservoirs to keep operations at safe temperatures. With soaring global temperatures, however, the water will simply be too warm to use, leaving power stations with little choice but to restrict output or fall foul of environmental practice. The past few years have seen large numbers of nuclear power plants across Europe operating at reduced capacity or brought to a halt because of hot summers. With the impending climate crisis this looks set to continue and will no doubt bring energy production to a standstill. It makes more sense to focus on energy efficiency and capture tide and wind power than to build nuclear power stations with their feet in the water. Given that climate change is a historic problem we shouldn't even be thinking about leaving the problem of nuclear waste to future generations. Jean Lambert MEP Green, London The government's seeming unwillingness to engage in a proper consultation over nuclear power is baffling. A true public discourse would prevent environmental groups from dominating the debate with accusations of secrecy that have so far seen the development of a rational energy policy thwarted. In Finland the government discussed the nuclear issue thoroughly in a variety of committees. As a result, campaigning by both sides was largely businesslike and lobbying restrained. The government was able to win the argument by engaging the public in an informed debate that left extremist groups at the margins. Let's hope the British government can learn from this. Helen Davison Energy research officer, Stockholm Network The case against a commitment to nuclear power now, which Alistair Darling needs to address, is much more powerful than even the letter from David Howarth MP and others (May 23) indicates. Generating companies are prepared to build carbon capture and storage plants now, especially the ones using old oil or gas fields. They will not buy \"second generation\" nuclear plants when the much preferable designs for \"third generation\" plants are expected to receive regulatory approval within a decade. Existing nuclear plants need to run continuously for long periods; but much of the continuous base load will now be met by wind power most of the time, so detailed studies will be needed for economic evaluation of the new designs. A government commitment to nuclear power would be a commitment to underwrite such risks as the enforced abandonment of a partially completed programme after another nuclear disaster, if one were to occur, and hostile military action using future long-range rockets. The safest and most economical solution for Britain may be to rely on non-nuclear technologies while there is the hope of fusion power. It is certainly an option worthy of government study. Dr Tony Abrams Stockport, Cheshire It is clear that new nuclear power stations cannot fill the energy gap forecast at 2015 - even with expedited planning and restricted public consultation. There are hence two basic questions: first, what alternative energy sources can we plan to use and, second, can the requirements for energy be significantly reduced? Wind power can only make a modest contribution, but investment in wave and tidal power at a level likely to be involved in building new nuclear plants would a) give a faster build-up of energy supplies, b) be a secure long-term source of supply with minimum adverse environmental impact, and c) be a boost to opportunities for engineering exports. We need new houses and to improve the energy efficiency of existing housing stock. If wood is used more extensively in building work then there will be savings in energy for construction materials and also a tying up of carbon in the wood, with the opportunity for new carbon capture by growing replacement trees.

But banks, chemical and tobacco groups are also keen to capitalise on growing business opportunities in the north African country after a long period when it was largely shut off because of western trade sanctions. Britain imported nearly £1bn of petroleum and other products in 2008 from Libya, 66% more than in 2007, and the export of \"visible\" goods from Britain rose by nearly 50% in the first half of the year, government figures show. Business analysts in the City, who asked not to be named, said the Libyan business environment was \"highly politicised\" and the release of the Lockerbie bomber could only help to oil the wheels of British commerce there. The Libyan British Business Council in London declined to comment on what impact the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi might have, highlighting the sensitivity of the affair. But the membership of the council, which includes BP, Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline and British American Tobacco, makes clear that blue-chip Britain is keen to do business there. BP broke new ground in 2007 when it signed a $900m (£545.5m) deal to search for oil and gas both on and offshore in Libya following a visit by Tony Blair, then prime minister. Shell and BG, formerly British Gas, have followed in its wake, alongside a rush of international firms such as Total of France, Lukoil of Russia and ExxonMobil of the US. British service companies, such as the Wood Group and AMEC, are also interested in Libya. Exxon hopes to drill the first ever well in very deep water off Libya but the real interest for many firms is not so much oil - as gas. British energy sector is desperately keen to replenish their UK reserves to fuel power stations and heat homes as North Sea production winds down. Gordon Brown has partly justified the need for new nuclear power on the grounds that the UK will otherwise become dependent on gas from Russia or other unstable countries of the Middle East. BP has already made clear it could spend up to $20bn in Libya if it finds enough gas to justify building a liquefied natural gas plant that could be used to export gas to Britain by ship.Libya obtains the vast majority of its income from hydrocarbons and used to produce 3.3m barrels of oil a day in the 1960s but since Western firms were kicked out during that decade these levels have been cut in half, made worse by the implementation of the now-lifted sanctions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2007/may/23/energy.scottishparliament","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-23T10:09:25Z","webTitle":"No showdown over nuclear power, insists Darling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/23/energy.scottishparliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/may/23/energy.scottishparliament","fields":{"headline":"No showdown over nuclear power, insists Darling","bodyText":"Nuclear power will continue to be generated in Scotland \"for the foreseeable future\" despite local opposition to new stations being built, the UK government said today. The trade and industry secretary, Alistair Darling, sought to play down suggestions of a looming showdown between London and Westminster after the first minister, Alex Salmond, said there was \"no chance\" of new nuclear stations being built in Scotland. More than a third of Scotland's electricity came from the Torness and Hunterston nuclear stations, said Mr Darling. \"Torness has got probably another 10 to 20 years life in it, so there is going to be nuclear power in Scotland for the foreseeable future,\" he said. Mr Darling was speaking hours before publication of an energy white paper which is expected to include nuclear power as part of a mix of energy sources that will also include renewables. But he accepted that the Scottish parliament could block future sites being built through devolved powers. Although energy policy is not devolved, Scottish ministers have control of the planning system and also have to give consent under the Electricity Act to the construction of new power stations above a certain size. \"We are not changing the devolution settlement. They have always had that power,\"Mr Darling told BBC Radio Scotland. \"The Scottish executive has the planning authority, it also has the right to veto connections to the grid - so they have always had that double lock. Nothing has changed in that respect.\" But he warned that blanket opposition to nuclear power and to windfarms was no answer to meeting future energy needs. \"Given the problems we face with climate change, given the fact that we cannot go on belching carbon into the atmosphere, given the fact that we are going to become more dependent on importing gas from countries like Russia and the Middle East, we have to have a sensible mix of generation,\" he said. Mr Darling told an audience in Aberdeen in March that the white paper would meet the challenges of securing supply and meeting environmental obligations, through an energy mix that included renewables, oil and gas - and, \"subject to consultation\", - nuclear. Labour in power in Scotland favoured keeping nuclear as part of the energy mix but the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Greens have resolutely opposed to nuclear new-build. Green MSP Patrick Harvie said last night: \"There is no need for confrontation between Holyrood and Westminster here - just different opinions and options being taken by two governments acting within their competencies. \"In Scotland we are awash with renewable resources and we will aim to take advantage of them. \"The rest of the UK can do the same but it is a shame there appears to be a willingness in Westminster to cling to the dirty technology of the past.\" The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Nicol Stephen, said directing government investment away from wind, wave and tidal power into nuclear would \"fatally damage\" Scotland's opportunity to become the renewables power house of Europe. \"Nuclear power has a history of hidden costs and is fraught with potential dangers.\" Jim Mather, the Holyrood minister responsible for energy, will set out the SNP administration's approach to an energy strategy in a speech today to the UK's biggest renewable energy conference in Aberdeen, bringing together more than 200 overseas delegates and 350 exhibitors. Meanwhile, the new SNP leader for Westminster - due to be announced later this morning - will spearhead the party's opposition to plans for new nuclear power stations. Friends of the Earth said the policy focus should be on \"much larger emission reductions\" by government without the need to press the nuclear option. Roger Higman, Friends of the Earth's campaigns co-ordinator, said: \"We can tackle climate change and keep the lights on without building new nuclear power stations. \"The government must promote energy saving measures - aimed at reducing emissions from homes and transport - as well as finding new ways to generate electricity. \"Unfortunately energy efficiency initiatives have so far been neglected in favour of hugely expensive proposals for a new nuclear programme, despite the fact that the government's own advisers have said that cutting emissions from other sources will be more cost effective and quicker.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/feb/17/iberdrola-scottish-power-record-profits-2008","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-17T14:48:57Z","webTitle":"Scottish Power helps Iberdrola to record profits for 2008","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/17/iberdrola-scottish-power-record-profits-2008","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/feb/17/iberdrola-scottish-power-record-profits-2008","fields":{"headline":"Strong boost from Scottish Power helps Iberdrola to record profits","bodyText":"Scottish Power contributed almost a quarter of record profits last year at Iberdrola, the Spanish utilities company, on the back of higher output and higher prices for consumers, it emerged today.

The power cuts that affected at least 500,000 people across the UK on Tuesday were caused by two separate incidents. The first happened in late morning on the Firth of Forth when Longannet power station, where one unit was running at reduced capacity after maintenance, went offline. Two minutes later, Sizewell B, the Suffolk nuclear power station, also went offline. According to National Grid, that means the system lost 1510 MW, causing the frequency at which it operates to fall. As a result, parts of the network were shut down automatically to protect the overall system, cutting off several hundred thousand customers. Q: Aren't there back-up systems in case this happens? There are. National Grid said that if one power plant had gone offline it would have been able to cope because the system automatically brings other generation into action in the case of a fall in frequency. Unfortunately that process is not instantaneous, and the system was not able to respond fast enough to cope with the loss of two plants in such a short space of time. Q: Why did the disruption continue over most of the afternoon? That was caused by a second incident. National Grid, having restored the frequency level after Longannet and Sizewell B's problems, then found a number of other power stations reporting they were going offline. Because this took place over a longer timespan the frequency fall did not recur, as Grid was able to bring in other generation. But it did cut into the normal 20% \"cushion\" – the excess of available capacity over demand – which National Grid keeps. As a result, it issued a series of notices warning it might have to restrict demand. In the event, it said, it was able to restore the cushion, although some companies did reduce their level of voltage to make the available electricity supply go further. Q: How much disruption was caused? The impact was isolated, so you may not have even been aware there was a problem. Residents of High Wycombe seem to have been particularly affected. The Eden shopping centre was plunged into darkness, and the local hospital had to suspend operations. According to the Bucks Free Press, the hospital's back-up generator kicked in when the normal power supply failed, only to catch fire. As John Bull, station manager at High Wycombe Fire Station, put it: \"The power went off and the generator kicked in and blew a gasket.\" In London, homes and businesses in south London were cut off, Clapham Junction railway station lost power, and there appear to have also been problems with traffic lights in the area. Cheshire, Lincolnshire, Liverpool and parts of the north east were also affected, with the Times reporting that eight people had to be rescued from a lift in Middlesbrough. Q: How rare is this disruption? Before yesterday, National Grid had not issued a Demand Control Imminent warning – the indication that the system could not cope – for around four years. Sizewell B has not gone offline for three-and-a-half years. Industry insiders have said that the scale of the disruption to the network, with as many as 11 power stations and generation units suffering disruption on the same day, has not been seen in a decade. Q: Has the problem now been fixed? We think so. British Energy hopes to get Sizewell B back into action within the next few days, but even without it National Grid says it is \"business as usual\". Q: Does it mean that Britain's electricity network can no longer cope with demand? It certainly raises questions about its resilience, and some analysts have criticised the government for not having acted sooner to bolster the network with new power stations. But David Porter, the chief executive of the Association of Electricity Producers, said the incident represented \"a gigantic coincidence\" and was not caused by a lack of investment. \"It is still possible for something like this to happen in exceptional circumstances, and the fact that power stations are either young or old is neither here nor there,\" Porter said today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2008/dec/09/media-barackobama","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-09T09:25:12Z","webTitle":"Worth a look: New Times poll, Richard Waters on Barack Obama, the Independent on David Ross, Caroline Spelman on general election plans, the Scotsman on nuclear power and Dave Hill on Boris Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/dec/09/media-barackobama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2008/dec/09/media-barackobama","fields":{"headline":"Worth a look","bodyText":"Gordon Brown notches up a nine-point poll lead over the Conservatives as the most trusted person to deal with the recession.

Above us, the fizz and drone of electricity cables that score the morning's pale blue sky. Ahead stands Sizewell nuclear power station, its huge white dome and buff-coloured concrete block dominating the horizon. Sizewell is made up of two nuclear power stations; Sizewell A, begun in 1961, ceased operational use in December 2006 and is now in the process of being decommissioned. Sizewell B is the UK's newest nuclear reactor, and was completed in 1995. Since French energy company EDF bought British Energy, plans are under way for Sizewell C, a decision that has proved controversial. A long, smooth road leads to the power plant. Signs slow the speed limit to 20mph, direct deliveries to Sizewell A and Sizewell B, and bring a caution: \"You are entering a nuclear licensed site.\" In the surrounding fields are signs of activity: yellow Buckhurst diggers, coils of black tubing, and along with the banks of white-blossomed trees, the birds swooping low, singing high and giddy, bringing a sense of something new, something just begun. Sizewell village is little more than a short run of houses. There is a small cluster of camper vans, a knot of fishing huts. The Vulcan Inn is quiet this lunchtime, save for a couple discussing their memories of the Queen's coronation; from the pub window is a view of workers making their way back up the road to the plant. Down on the front, the beach cafe is closed, though the car park is busy with dog-walkers and day-trippers. There is a salmon-pink house, a blue Subaru, a red telephone box. Sunshine warms the quiet road and a blue-flowered buddleja frames a view of Sizewell's white dome. Ian Smith leans over his garden wall. A building surveyor, he moved here two years ago from Hertfordshire. \"It was a random choice, literally just a pin in the map,\" he says. \"I'd never been to Suffolk before I moved here.\" The power plant did not concern him. \"I didn't think twice about it; the plant just sits there, it doesn't do anything. And I've the beach on the doorstep, the dog is happy, and you can do what you like, especially in the winter, there's hardly anybody here then.\" The relationship between the locals and the power plant is amicable, Smith says. \"They're very good about keeping us informed; there are regular meetings and they write to us.\" Most of Sizewell's houses are now holiday homes, he adds. There are just three permanent residents in the village: Smith, his neighbour Brian, and the publican. The locals, he says, do not object to the plant, or to the proposed new reactor. \"Just about everyone is employed there in one capacity or another,\" he explains. A few weeks ago, a group of anti-nuclear protesters descended on Sizewell. \"They hung around here for about an hour then went and camped on the beach,\" says Smith. \"It was supposed to commemorate 25 years since the Chernobyl disaster I think. Most of them weren't old enough to remember Chernobyl. It was all a bit lacklustre.\" Towards the beach the grass grows coarse, bleached by the sea and riddled with rabbit holes. Small boats are piled on the rise before the shore, painted in faded blues and peeling whites, their names daubed in black: The Hannah Jayne, the Phoenix, Segui. On the shingle sits a child's red spade, curls of dried seaweed, bursts of white foam. Today the waves are brownish-grey monsters, rearing and bucking against the land. There comes the constant roar of the wind, the boom of the sea, and the air tastes cool and honeyish. The cars in the car park, the benches on the seafront, the houses, the boats, all stand with their backs to the power plant, their faces turned towards the sea. But in this twitching, turning landscape, the plant offers a strange, steady presence; there on the hill, gazing down over Suffolk's rich green fields, looking out across the muddy North Sea, a block of grey concrete and a white balloon, peeping through the hedgerows."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2007/may/20/leaders.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-19T23:16:41Z","webTitle":"Leader: Nuclear power is the only realistic option","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/20/leaders.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/may/20/leaders.comment","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power is the only realistic option","bodyText":"On wednesday, the government will publish a white paper on energy policy. It will promote the building of a new generation of nuclear plants. The decision to run more of Britain with atomic power will get a clear endorsement from Gordon Brown. Doubtless, much discussion of the white paper will focus on the environment. New nuclear power stations have not exactly been a traditional green aspiration and the questions of safety, especially the treatment of toxic waste, remain highly contentious. There have been some technological advances since the heyday of anti-nuclear protests in the 1980s, but no magic solutions. Meanwhile, a greater environmental threat has emerged in the form of manmade carbon dioxide emissions. Nuclear power is hardly a carbon-neutral enterprise, but in terms of energy output, it contributes less to global warming than fossil fuels. For the long-term future, Britain needs consistent investment in truly sustainable energy sources. There is allowance for that in the white paper with an expansion of wind farms. Meanwhile, nuclear is the least worst option. And not just for environmental reasons. As existing facilities become obsolete, Britain will become ever more reliant - by up to 90 per cent - on energy imports, mainly from the Gulf states and Russia. That presents an unacceptable risk both in terms of security of supply and foreign policy. The UK government already bends over backwards to appease the Saudi royal family despite its brutal and increasingly tenuous hold on power. Iraq is dangerously unstable. Britain is hardly inclined to go gas shopping in Iran. Russia, while politically stable, aggressively uses its oil and gas reserves for diplomatic leverage and, in some cases, to destabilise its clients. A recent EU-Russia summit meeting, in which East-West oil and gas supply was top of the agenda, was conducted under a cloud of mutual suspicion. It was upset partly by Russia's campaign of vindictive intimidation against Estonia. The Kremlin has still failed to grasp the idea that its former Soviet possessions are now sovereign states and often uses energy policy to bully them. Britain must not depend on such a regime to power its economy. Homegrown fossil fuels are not an option, nor, for the time being, can Britain's needs be met exclusively by wind farms. For those blunt strategic reasons, as much as environmental concerns, the government is right to go nuclear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212450","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-02T19:40:01Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: US diplomats in Slovenia asked to compile 'biometric' data on 'current and emerging leaders and advisors'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212450","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212450","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: US diplomats in Slovenia asked to compile 'biometric' data on 'current and emerging leaders and advisors'","bodyText":"Tuesday, 16 June 2009, 21:48 S E C R E T STATE 062397 NOFORN EO 12958 DECL: 06/11/2034 TAGS PINR, KSPR, ECON, SI SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: SLOVENIA REF: STATE 18774 Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS.

Dibble, Charge d'Affaires, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). Summary ------- 1. (C/NF) Mr. President, your meeting with Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi comes at a time when his closest advisors fear Italy is losing the credibility and influence that it enjoyed in Washington under the previous U.S. administration. In fact, while Italy has been a stalwart partner and participant in nearly every U.S.-led security operation around the world since the end of the Cold War, domestic political foibles and economic malaise are diluting its international influence. Italy continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iraq, and the Balkans, but its diplomatic, economic and military institutions, which the Berlusconi government and its predecessors have starved for resources, are sorely stretched. Berlusconi and his government have tried to compensate for Italy's failure to invest in its instruments of national power by presenting Italy as a mediator and interlocutor with difficult actors on major international issues. This self-appointed role has sometimes complicated international efforts. On Iran, for example, Italy's role under the previous government gave Tehran the impression that the international community was divided. More recently, GOI actions have provided a European platform for Russia's efforts to challenge NATO security interests in Europe. Berlusconi will certainly present himself as the best hope for moderating Russian behavior and will seek a signal from you that he has a mandate to speak on the West's behalf. He will also seek to use Italy's G8 presidency to address issues far beyond the scope and effectiveness of the organization. We should discourage both instincts. Italy has an important voice in the Euro-Atlantic community, but its efforts have proven constructive only when undertaken in coordination with the U.S. and other key allies. Berlusconi the Politician ------------------------- 2. (C/NF) Our relationship with Berlusconi is complex. He is vocally pro-American and has helped address our interests on many levels in a manner and to a degree that the previous government was unwilling or unable to do, since his return to power last spring as well as in his previous turns in government. In his first 90 days in office, he approved a controversial U.S. base expansion that had been halted by bureaucratic inaction and anti-American political opposition; eliminated caveats on Italian troops in Afghanistan; and allowed us to base two of three AFRICOM component commands in Italy. At the same time, he has criticized Missile Defense, NATO enlargement and support for Kosovo's independence as American provocations of Russia. He claimed Russian PM Putin's military push into Georgia in August 2008 was necessary to end the bloodshed of innocents caused by Georgian President Saakashvili. He displays an overweening self-confidence born of stable and strong political popularity that has made him deaf to dissenting opinion. The strict control he exercises over his government and party inhibits his staff from giving him unpleasant messages. His unorthodox governing style, coupled with his frequent verbal gaffes and high-profile scandals (including public bickering with his wife about his alleged philandering), have caused many, including some inside the U.S. government, to dismiss him as feckless, vain, and ineffective as a modern European leader. 3. (C/NF) His shortcomings notwithstanding, marginalizing Berlusconi would limit important cooperation with a key ally. Berlusconi is one of Europe's most enduring politicians whose popularity in Italy will guarantee that he will influence Italian politics for many years still to come. He has arrested the trend of weak, short-lived Italian governments that has plagued this country since the end of the Second World War. When successfully engaged, he has shown the willingness to adopt policies, however unpopular, in line with ours -- including support for an expanded NATO role in Afghanistan and Turkey's membership in the EU. When ignored, he seeks to carve out a visible, international, and ROME 00000649 002.6 OF 004 frequently unhelpful role for himself. Dealing with Berlusconi, therefore, requires a careful balance of close coordination with him and his key advisors while avoiding giving the impression that he can speak on our behalf with many of the world's difficult actors. 4. (C/NF) Italy held elections for the European Parliament on June 6 and 7, which reaffirmed Berlusconi's People of Liberty (PDL) party as Italy's largest party, reaching 35 percent, well ahead of the main opposition Democratic Party's 26 percent. While Berlusconi does not have a competitive rival in the center left, his party missed the 40 percent mark that it was aiming for, and witnessed the growth of xenophobic coalition ally Northern League (LN). PDL is a personality-driven party, whose members tell us that the ideology is little more than \"Berlusconismo.\" The missed target of 40 percent can be attributed to an over-ambitious Berlusconi, as well as the turnout-depressing effects of weeks of personal attacks by the center left in the runup to the election that included allegations of fiscal and sexual impropriety. An enduring result of the election will be the heightened competition between PDL and LN, who now dominate Italian politics. LN's tough stands on security and against immigration have won broad approval, even as Berlusconi has tried to stem the flow of PDL voters to LN by descending to the anti-immigrant rhetoric usually favored by the Northern League. Additionally, after this mild electoral setback, we can expect Berlusconi to use his White House meeting and his hosting of the G8 to underscore to Italians the important figure he cuts on the world stage. Economic Crisis --------------- 5. (C) Prudent (some would say stodgy) banking practices allowed Italy to avoid the global financial sector meltdown. Italy's banks simply did not engage in sub-prime lending, and they did not buy the toxic assets that caused so much trouble in the U.S. and elsewhere. But Italy has not been able to avoid the pain of the worldwide recession that has followed the financial crisis. Italy's economic growth rate -- which was relatively low even before the crisis -- has dropped precipitously owing to sharp contractions in its export markets and falling domestic demand. Unemployment is expected to exceed eight percent this year and to rise further in 2010. Government tax revenues are, not unexpectedly, off sharply. Italy's already high level of government debt and the debt ceilings that come with EU membership significantly limit the government's ability to provide fiscal stimulus for the economy. G8 -- 6. (C/NF) Berlusconi's stewardship of his G8 Presidency has been marked by a proliferation of Ministerial and sub-ministerial meetings coupled with a last-minute change of summit venue from Sardinia to the earthquake-stricken city of L'Aquila that took even his Sherpa by surprise. He and his cabinet tend to regard Italy's G8 year more as an opportunity to curry favor with G8 outsiders such as Egypt, Spain, and Libya than as a tool to address the world's problems. However, his desire to prevent the G8 from taking a back seat to the G20 on his watch has driven an ambitious agenda that may make useful contributions on climate change, Africa, development, and food security. He will be eager to work with you to build a legacy of G8 deliverables that will bear the Italian label. The Major Economies Forum meeting during the G8 summit, which will include the leaders of 17-plus countries that emit over 80 percent of global emissions, will be an important chance to mobilize high-level consensus in the run-up to the December UN climate change talks in Copenhagen. Guantanamo Detainees -------------------- 7. (C/NF) Berlusconi welcomed your decision to close Guantanamo, and has publicly and repeatedly underscored Italy's desire to support the move by taking detainees. FM Frattini recently outlined for AG Holder the efforts Italian officials have been making within the EU to negotiate a ROME 00000649 003.6 OF 004 common EU framework that will open the door to individual country agreements with the U.S. While the junior partner in Berlusconi's coalition opposes taking any detainees, Berlusconi has made it clear that he views this as a moral commitment to support the U.S. Russia ------ 8. (C/NF) Dependence on Russian energy, lucrative and frequently nontransparent business dealings between Italy and Russia, and a close, personal relationship between Berlusconi and Putin have distorted the PM's view to the point that he believes much of the friction between the West and Russia has been caused by the U.S. and NATO. Berlusconi believes he, acting as a mediator, can restore a spirit of dialogue and cooperation between Europe, the U.S. and Russia, but largely on Russia's terms, through indefinitely postponing NATO's outreach to Ukraine and Georgia, diluting the EU's efforts to promote democracy in Belarus, and undermining OSCE's important role in promoting human and democratic values across the whole of Europe. Berlusconi has publicly proposed to mediate your relationship with Russian President Medvedev and is hoping you will give him a signal, however small, that he has your blessing to do so. Instead, you can let him know that we believe that issues of security that affect the transatlantic community should be addressed by the Alliance at large, and that the U.S. is not prepared to sacrifice values in exchange for short-term stability predicated on Russian promises of good behavior. And we will react -- and expect others who share these values to do so as well -- when Russia crosses a red-line, for instance in threatening the sovereignty of neighboring states. Energy ------ 9. (C/NF) Berlusconi's close personal ties with Putin and the very strong corporate ties between Italian energy parastatal ENI and Russia's Gazprom often put Italy squarely at odds with USG efforts to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian energy. For example, the Italian government is deeply ambivalent about energy projects that would help Europe diversify its energy imports, while at the same time it is supportive of other projects that would increase Europe's Russian energy dependency. ENI, 30-percent owned by the Italian Government, often dictates GOI energy policy and uses its influence, through the GOI, to block EU energy market liberalization plans. Italy is taking some steps, however, in the right direction, by supporting energy projects that will diversify its own energy sources. It would be helpful if you could raise with Berlusconi long-standing USG concerns about European energy security, emphasizing that increasing the flow of Russian gas around Ukraine is not the same as a policy seeking a true diversity of energy sources, routes and technologies. 10. (C) The Berlusconi Government is pursuing plans to bring back nuclear power to Italy. U.S.-based companies Westinghouse and GE face stiff competition from foreign rivals, particularly France, whose governments are heavily lobbying the GOI. A word to Berlusconi that the U.S. expects this to be a fair and transparent competition is critical if U.S. firms are to have a fair chance to bid for Italian nuclear energy projects. Iran ---- 11. (C/NF) With Italy frustrated by its exclusion from the P5-plus-1 negotiating circle, Berlusconi will highlight Italy's would-be role as an interlocutor between the West, Israel and Iran, claiming excellent relations with all parties involved. He may also push for the U.S. to drop the P5 1 framework altogether. Italian officials were thrilled by your commitment to embark upon direct diplomatic engagement with Iran, but cannot resist the impulse to try to be \"present at the creation.\" FM Frattini has worked strenuously to lock in high-level Iranian attendance at the June 26-27 Afghanistan-Pakistan Outreach meeting, hoping thereby to play host to the first U.S.-Iranian ministerial encounter in decades. ROME 00000649 004.7 OF 004 Libya ----- 12. (C/NF) Berlusconi has continued Italy's policy of developing an expanded relationship with Libya, largely in order to stem the tide of irregular migration from Libyan shores, but also to gain advantageous access to Libya's oil reserves for Italian firms, mainly ENI. As follow-up to the 2008 Libya-Italy Friendship Treaty -- which committed Libya to sterner measures to deter irregular migrants from entering Italy from its shores, but also offered 5 billion USD in development assistance -- Libyan leader Qadhafi will pay an historic first official visit to Rome June 10-12, just before Berlusconi's Washington visit. As the current African Union President, Qadhafi will be at the G8 Summit in L'Aquila and we anticipate Berlusconi may lobby you to meet with the Libyan leader during your visit. A Partner in Security --------------------- 13. (C/NF) Berlusconi has maintained a significant military commitment in Afghanistan (2,600 troops, mostly in Italy's Regional-Command West), but has dropped from fourth- to sixth-largest ISAF contributor as other countries like France and Canada have augmented their troop levels. At Stasbourg-Kehl, his government pledged modest increases to cover election security which, if made permanent, would put Italy back in the top tier of ISAF contributors. He has also supported the creation of the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan, doubling the number of Carabinieri police trainers to over 100. Italy has been an anemic contributor to international aid efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan and has cut overall foreign assistance by more than 60 percent in this year's budget. However, Berlusconi knows this is a priority area for the U.S. and will likely respond positively if you press him to do more in the region. 14. (C) Our shared security interests with Italy go beyond Afghanistan. U.S. facilities in Italy provide unmatched freedom of action and are critical to our ability to project stability into the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa. We have 15,000 U.S. military on six Italian bases and these installations host some of our most advanced capabilities deployed outside the U.S. Our bases and activities out of Italy are not uniformly popular, but PM Berlusconi, in this government as in his last, has made preserving this security relationship a priority, and the GOI has invariably come through on our top requests, despite domestic political risks. The GOI has approved the expansion of our base at Vicenza to consolidate the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the deployment of the USAF Global Hawk UAV in Sicily, and the establishment of AFRICOM Army and Navy Component Commands on Italian soil. Italy's leadership in other overseas missions helps us concentrate our forces on our top priorities. In addition to its troops in Afghanistan, Italy currently has 2,300 in the Balkans, 2,400 in Lebanon, and is the leading contributor to the NATO Training Mission in Iraq. Conclusion ---------- 15. (C/NF) The robust U.S.-Italian relationship provides us with major national security benefits in our military missions overseas, our own power projection, and on a broad law enforcement agenda, but the Prime Minister is an erratic steward. It might be tempting to dismiss Berlusconi as a frivolous interlocutor, with his personal foibles, public gaffes and sometimes unpredictable policy judgment, but we believe this would be a mistake. Despite his faults, Berlusconi has been the touchstone of Italian politics for the last 15 years, and every indication is that he will be around for years to come. When we are able to successfully engage him in pursuit of our common objectives, he has proved an ally and friend to the United States. He respects and admires the U.S., and is eager to build a strong and successful relationship with you.

The huge £1.8bn plant at Sellafield imports spent nuclear fuel from around the world and returns it to countries as new reactor fuel. But a series of catastrophic technical failures with associated equipment means Thorp could be mothballed at a cost of millions of pounds. Under strict orders from the government's safety watchdog, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the plant's operators, Sellafield Ltd, is expected to have little option but to mothball the reprocessing plant for at least four years. Closure of Thorp for any length of time could cost the company and government hundreds of millions of pounds and embarrass the resurgent nuclear industry, which is embarking on an ambitious programme of new reactors for Britain. Thorp is contracted to reprocess more than 700 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel, most of it for Germany, which could sue if Sellafield does not return it on time. A Sellafield Ltd spokesman said that a technical inquiry had been launched into options for the complex. He said: \"Thorp is working well but one of the downstream plants that supplies Thorp has problems. At this stage we do not know what impact it will have. It is being assessed now. [It may mean] Sellafield does not have the normal capacity to deal with a high-level nuclear waste stream. Even if we do have the capacity, then Thorp may have to be closed down.\" Yesterday nuclear critics urged Sellafield Ltd to close Thorp immediately. Martin Forwood, spokesman for Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment (Core), said: \"The crisis … can only be bad news for Thorp, which already has a dreadful operational record. It would make sense to put this white elephant out of its misery permanently. The plug should be pulled on Thorp, preferably for good but at least for four or five years.\" The problem involves three evaporator plants that serve Thorp. The two oldest have been running intermittently following repeated breakdowns, and the third has been closed after a rise in radioactivity levels was discovered. Work has started on a new £100m evaporator, but it is believed to be two years behind schedule and unlikely to open before 2013. The latest technical hitches are embarrassing for the government, which hopes to use Sellafield as the centre of a huge British nuclear industry, with the Cumbrian coast expected to host a new enormous waste depository as well as possibly two new nuclear power stations. Closure could also slow the decommissioning of other nuclear reactors in Britain. Revenue from Thorp was expected to provide much of the £70bn conservatively estimated to be needed to decommission Britain's reactors and clean up the environment after 50 years of nuclear power. Most first-generation UK reactors are expected to have closed within 10 years. Evidence that drastic action may have to be taken on Thorp has been mounting for months. Recent reviews by Sellafield Ltd have assessed alternative options for the plant's future, including a moratorium on reprocessing and, as a second option, operating it for only part of the year. Sellafield's problems have been compounded since the Nuclear Inspectorate put a legal limit on the amounts of highly radioactive liquid that can be stored at Sellafield. Yesterday, Sellafield Ltd said that stocks of high-level liquid waste had fallen \"significantly\" in recent months. Construction of Thorp began in the 1970s and was completed in 1994. The £1.8bn plant went into operation in 1997 with the assurance from its then owners, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, that it would reprocess 7,000 tonnes of spent fuel in its first 10 years of operation, two-thirds of the business coming from abroad. To date, Thorp has completed about 6,000 tonnes of its initial order book and is now, largely as a result of the broken evaporators, limited to processing 200 tonnes a year – about a sixth of its original design capacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2007/may/24/communities.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-24T08:35:39Z","webTitle":"Prime sites for nuclear power stations identified","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/24/communities.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2007/may/24/communities.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Prime sites for nuclear power stations identified","bodyText":"The government is considering building nuclear power stations on the sites of old coal and gas-fired stations in Oxfordshire and the south-east, according to documents released yesterday as part of a consultation forced on it by the courts. A confidential report, commissioned by the DTI last year from leading energy analysts Jackson Consulting, has recommended a new generation of plants at existing or redundant civil and military nuclear power stations. But it says that many of these will be unavailable for years or will be unsuitable because they have limited connections to the national grid. Instead, the consultants say that \"existing coal and/or gas-fired conventional power stations\" should be considered for new nuclear sites. A further option would be to develop stations at \"completely new greenfield sites\". Of the 19 existing civil nuclear power station sites, only nine are considered feasible for new reactors, and only four of these are available immediately. However, the DTI has been advised that the sites of conventional power stations in the Midlands, the south coast near Brighton, and near Bristol could become available. The advice to ministers was outlined in a 50-page report, the only one known to have been commissioned by government specifically on the issue of the siting of new nuclear plants. It was submitted to the DTI last year and attempts by Greenpeace to make it public under freedom of information rules were repeatedly blocked. The study was finally disclosed yesterday, when the government published its latest energy white paper. This offered clear support for new nuclear plants but a fresh round of consultation has been demanded by the high court. Alistair Darling, the industry secretary, said that this would only take 20 weeks and argued it would be a \"profound mistake\" to rule out nuclear energy at a time of dwindling North Sea oil and gas supplies and pressure to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. \"Quite simply, in the public interest, we need to make a decision this year on whether we should continue to get some of our electricity from nuclear because new stations take a long time to build. If nuclear is excluded there is every chance that its place would be taken by gas or coal generation which, of course, emit carbon,\" he said. According to the Jackson report, ease of connection to the national grid is the main factor in determining a site's suitability. This suggests that the best available location at present is at Harwell, a former military site close to Didcot power station in Oxfordshire. In the second rung of grid suitability come old coal-fired stations, but these are not mentioned by name. Only two nuclear sites that are immediately available - at Sizewell and Hinkley - are considered to be suitable to take new generation twin reactors. Eight of the 19 current nuclear sites considered by Jackson have limited grid connection and three - at Trawsfynydd and Wylfa in north Wales, Berkeley near Gloucester and Heysham in Lancashire are more or less ruled out with \"major barriers that would be difficult to overcome\". The report adds that new stations are unlikely to be feasible in Wales or Scotland because of devolution. While most existing reactors are on the coast, the report says it would be possible to build new ones inland. But these, it says, would need vast cooling towers, \"as used by conventional coal and gas- fired generating stations such as Didcot in Oxfordshire\". It says: \"Cooling towers are very large structures which substantially damage the local amenity value from visual intrusion, causing significant difficulties with local public acceptance, as well as adding to the cost of construction and reducing the station's power output 3-5%.\" The report highlights nuclear waste organisation Nirex's anxiety that the sites most prone to flooding from rising sea levels are in the low-lying areas of the south of England - exactly where electricity demand is forecast to be greatest. It states that new nuclear power stations would have to be engineered and designed to take this into account. Greenpeace director John Sauven said: \"Scientists say the speed at which climate change is happening means that some of the sites suggested for new nuclear power stations are threatened by rising sea levels and storm surges. You have to question where the government thinks it's going to build these things. \"The list of preferred sites for new build in this report is a matter of national interest, not just something for civil servants to see. It's scandalous the government was going to keep this under wraps.\" The DTI said last night that the report's conclusions were those of the consultants and it was too early to consider the siting of any potential new stations. A spokesman said private companies would ultimately propose where they should be built."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/nov/17/iran-russia-turkey-khamenei-erdogan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-17T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Is Iran dropping Russia for Turkey? | Meir Javedanfar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/17/iran-russia-turkey-khamenei-erdogan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/17/iran-russia-turkey-khamenei-erdogan","fields":{"headline":"Is Iran dropping Russia for Turkey?","bodyText":"The famous Chinese strategist, Sun Tzu, wrote in his book, The Art of War: \"If an enemy has alliances, the problem is grave and the enemy's position strong; if he has no alliances, the problem is minor and the enemy's position weak.\" Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is currently witnessing how the US, which he sees as the enemy for his nuclear ambitions, is working hard on building alliances, including with Russia. Khamenei is not happy. So much so that Iran recently cancelled a deal with Russia to launch its communication satellite, and turned to Italy instead. This is in addition to recent complaints from Tehran regarding delays from Russia in the delivery of the S-300 anti-aircraft system. Until recently, Tehran kept its complaints away from the cameras and behind closed doors. But now that Khamenei sees the Russians as disloyal, his regime is not shy about airing its criticism publicly. The Iranian government has decided to take the initiative and to look for a new partner to replace the Russians. Judging by the recent flurry of visits between Tehran and Ankara, it seems that Khamenei has found a willing partner in Turkey. Unlike Russia, Turkey does not have a veto in the UN security council. However, its stock in the Middle East and the Islamic world is certainly rising. Its prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is being seen more and more as a credible defender of Islamic and Arab issues. Many people on the Arab street respect his leadership, as he was elected in a genuinely democratic elections. The same can not be said about Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, or King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who received their posts undemocratically. Erdogan's relations with the US and the EU also count in his favour. Although he has recently been getting closer to his Muslim and Arab regional neighbours, he has not severed his ties with the west, but is masterfully playing both sides. His relations with the US are also not based on Turkey's weaknesses. On one occasion, he resisted US pressure and even walked away from a promise of $6bn in grants and $20bn loan guarantees, because he did not find the agreement suitable. And his verbal attacks on Israel after the recent Gaza war have certainly helped his image in the region. Now that Khamenei has turned down Barack Obama's nuclear offer, he feels that the prospect of sanctions is greater. Therefore, he needs a change of strategy to deal with the expected difficult time ahead. One strategy is to turn his struggle against Obama into a new west v Islam confrontation. Judging by the recent international TV debate in Qatar, where Iran's nuclear programme was discussed in front of a select audience from the Middle East, there certainly is sympathy for his position. As far as many people in the region are concerned, Iran's nuclear programme is the only way to counter Israel's superior balance of power. Therefore this is a viable strategy. And Erdogan's rising popularity in the region, and Tehran's improving relations with his administration, will be a feasible way for Khamenei to improve his own position during the difficult times ahead. The absence of progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace track will also help him. However, the Iranian supreme leader should be careful about how he approaches his relations with Turkey and the price he is willing to pay for it, both at home and abroad. According to the Iranian news website Khabar online, the Ahmadinejad government concluded a secret gas agreement with Turkey in late October, without informing parliament. After the news was recently leaked to the press, parliament launched a full investigation. There are now discussions about cancelling the whole deal if, as the members of parliament say, it is found to be against the country's interests. Many people suspect that Khamenei offered the deal in unfavourably good conditions to Ankara, as a means of buying its loyalty. Judging by its results it seems to have worked. However, the domestic backlash could damage the legitimacy of his regime even further. There is also the issue of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Turkey can not complete it. Only Russia can. Khamenei turning his back on Moscow could be even more detrimental to this important and expensive project. Perhaps Khamenei could learn from the Turks, and instead of constantly changing one ally for another learn to balance his alliances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/10/copenhagen-climate-change-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-10T19:14:39Z","webTitle":"Copenhagen climate change summit: The issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/10/copenhagen-climate-change-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/10/copenhagen-climate-change-summit","fields":{"headline":"Copenhagen climate change summit: The issues","bodyText":"What is the Copenhagen climate change summit? The UN meeting is the deadline for thrashing out a successor to the Kyoto protocol, with the aim of preventing dangerous global warming. It will run for two weeks from 7 December and is the latest in a series that trace their origins to the 1992 Earth summit in Rio. What's the bottom line? Climate scientists are convinced the world must stop the growth in greenhouse gas emissions and start making them fall very soon. To have a chance of keeping warming under the dangerous 2C mark, cuts of 25%-40% relative to 1990 levels are needed, rising to 80%-95% by 2050. So far, the offers on the table are way below these targets. Who should make the cuts? That is a crunch issue. The industrialised nations such as the US, UK, Japan and others have emitted by far the most carbon and still emit vast amounts per person, so have a responsibility to make the deep cuts scientists demand. But emissions from emerging economies such as China and India are surging, and any global limit on emissions needs curbs on those nations, too. Yet, per person, those nations have small carbon footprints and millions of people in deep poverty – 400 million Indians live without electricity, for example. So China, India and others can argue they need to be allowed to continue to pollute for a while as they improve their citizens' lives. Balancing the responsibilities for cuts is a key part of the negotiations. Who is going to pay? The other crunch issue. There is an argument that, in the long term, a low-carbon economy will be cheaper than a fossil-fuelled one, and represents a fantastic investment. But time is short and there will be costs in the near term. All agree that the poorest nations need urgent help. Citizens in places from Haiti to Sudan to Bangladesh have done virtually nothing to pollute the atmosphere, but are bearing the worst impacts of floods and droughts. Richer nations will need to pay billions from now – some call it reparations for damage to the Earth's climate. It will also cost a lot to build the global clean energy infrastructure essential to staunch the carbon from coal and gas power stations, responsible for a large part of global emissions. For the fast emerging economies, such as India, the ideal is to skip the high-carbon growth phase entirely and go straight to renewables and perhaps nuclear power. Again, rich nations will be expected to pick up the tab. for this -– iIf they don't, there is little incentive to stop building coal-fired plants. Gordon Brown and the EU have suggested $100bn a year from 2020 would cover the global climate change bill. But estimates from development groups reach up to four times that amount. Finding a figure that all nations accept is the second key part of the negotiations. What about carbon trading? In theory, buying permits to pollute from those who can cut their emissions most cheaply is attractive – maximum bang per buck and a flow of cash to pay for investments. However, from one perspective, this kind of offsetting simply looks like paying poorer people to clear up the mess left by the rich, who can then continue to pollute. Also, if carbon trading is to cut real emissions, the cap set on the market has to be tight and, to date, political imperatives have overridden those of the planet. Nonetheless, carbon trading will remain at the heart of any treaty sealed in Copenhagen, as it was in the Kyoto treaty. Is stopping deforestation an easier way to cut emission? About 40% of all the carbon emitted by human activity has come from razing forests. Stopping deforestation is, in principle, cheap and simple: do not cut them down. But paying people – via carbon credits – not to fell trees soon becomes complex. Who really owns the trees? Were they going to be chopped down anyway? And how do you verify what actually happens? Finding a solution to these issues is one of the strongest hopes for the Copenhagen summit. What are the prospects for a Copenhagen deal? Negotiations held in September in Barcelona were grim: all now acknowledge that no legal deal is possible in Copenhagen. A miracle is needed for a triumph. President Barack Obama is the one who could deliver it, but it is very unlikely. Most likely is a hopeful fudge in which all parties remain on speaking terms and seal the deal in 2010. A total collapse would leave 20 years' of negotiations in tatters and the world unprotected against the ravages of global warming. It is also unlikely, but not as unlikely as a miracle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cleantechrevolution2009/geared-up-and-ready-to-go","type":"article","sectionId":"cleantechrevolution2009","sectionName":"The Clean Tech Revolution","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-18T14:09:44Z","webTitle":"Geared up and ready to go","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cleantechrevolution2009/geared-up-and-ready-to-go","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cleantechrevolution2009/geared-up-and-ready-to-go","fields":{"headline":"Geared up and ready to go","bodyText":"Category: Power generation Winner: Artemis Intelligent Power Finalists: Acal Energy; Cascade Technologies How to make best use of fuel available to us has been a constant challenge over thousands of years, starting with simple bonfires, through steam engines, to nuclear power and gas turbines. Development has accelerated over the past few centuries, with each generation of engineers finding ways of making the extraction of energy on a bigger scale or more efficiently. The power generation category of the Carbon Trust awards highlights the very latest breakthroughs in this field. Developing ways to extract power from fossil fuels more efficiently and making new, carbon-neutral fuels more commercially viable are the two tasks the power sector has to underake constantly to help meet its very large responsibility of tackling the threat of climate change. And the entrants in this category show advances come in some unexpected places. Category winner Artemis Intelligent Power (which also won the overall Carbon Trust award because of its versatility in several other sectors such as transport) found a way of making the transmission of energy from the blades of a windmill to its turbine more efficient. Finalists in the same category were Cascade Technologies and Acal Energy. Cascade claims to be able to reduce emissions from a ship's engines by 14%. With the shipping industry under heavy pressure to reduce emissions, this technology could be a vital first step in saving it money and reducing its carbon footprint. Acal has provided a bold new advance for fuel cell technology, a power source with great promise that has so far not been fulfilled. The system replaces expensive metals like platinum with cheaper and more durable liquid catalysts. The results in this category are a blow to people who think green technology is a succession of big, shiny, complex pieces of kit. The engineers who actually work on the technology know something different: it is the insides and increments that matter. The modern wind turbine was designed several decades ago and the way it works (wind turns the blades, blades turn a turbine, turbine generates electricity) is virtually unaltered today. That isn't to say, of course, that the thousands of offshore machines that will be installed around the UK in the coming decade, to help meet the government's ambitious target to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, will be identical to their forebears from the 70s. Everything from the basic construction materials to the shape of the blades to the efficiency of turbines has been pored over, improved and re-modelled in that time. These increments have slowly made the technology more commercially viable and thus a more practical choice for tackling climate change. Artemis's winning formula is a big step in that incremental progress. Its Digital Displacement® technology, designed for the transmission systems that transfer the power of the blades to the turbine, promises to make ever larger wind turbines more efficient and cheaper to install. Tackling inefficiency Artemis decided that power systems could be made more efficient by tackling transmission inefficiencies. In wind turbines, the complex gearboxes waste energy and are prone to fail. Increasing weight can push up construction costs and heavier, more complex systems inevitably lead to an increase in the overall price of electricity for the consumer. Replacing the gearbox with a hydraulic system weighing 30 tonnes less means Artemis can shave significant weight from the nacelle of a typical offshore turbine.This makes the wind turbine cheaper and easier to deploy. All offshore turbines being designed today require any power they generate to be processed through power electronics. Artemis allows power generation with a synchronous generator at medium voltage, saving the 3% losses of low-voltage, full-power electronic conversion. By removing the power electronics, the wind turbine also has a lower operating and maintenance cost, which is especially important for offshore applications where fixing problems can involve expensive boat trips in rough seas. The Artemis system also allows wind turbines to use more of the available energy on the windiest days. A standard wind turbine will have a limit for the amount of power it can handle at once, meaning it has to shed the excess driving its blades on very gusty days. The onboard energy storage in the Artemis system means wind turbines can capture, rather than waste, this extra energy. Following development over six years with help from the Carbon Trust, Artemis concluded a trial in March of a prototype of its technology. The company says its hydraulic transmission has clear benefits for renewable power, including higher power density and better tolerance to shock. It says its hydraulic transmission can save 7,900 tonnes of CO2 for a 6MW machine. It has also been working with Pelamis Wave Power, whose hydraulic sea snake is the world's leading wave-energy converter. A farm of the sea snakes has already been deployed at test scale off the coast of Portugal; more are planned around the UK as the wave energy sector ramps up. Using the digital displacement transmission from Artemis will increase electrical production in the Pelamis device in the range of 7 to 10%. The company's latest success came with a grant from the government's Department for Energy and Climate Change, which will allow Artemis to demonstrate its technology in a wind turbine at megawatt scale.

The ETS market may see $3tn (£1.8tn) worth of transactions a year in the next decade or two, according to Andrew Ager, head of emissions trading at Bache Commodities in London, with it even being used as a hedge against falling equities or rising inflation. \"It is still a relatively new industry with annual trades of around €300bn every year. But this could grow to around $3tn compared to the $1.5tn market there is for oil,\" says Ager, who used to be a foreign currencies trader. The speed of that growth will depend on whether the Copenhagen summit gives a go-ahead for a low-carbon economy, but Ager says whatever happens schemes such as the ETS will expand around the globe. Last week Australia gave its strongest sign yet that it would establish its own trading market, while the US is moving towards a similar scheme in a bid to find market-based ways to accelerate the transition to a lower carbon economy. Many political leaders, especially in industrialised countries, are enthusiastic: carbon markets hold the promise of cost-efficient emission cuts without the need for taxpayer funding. But their enthusiasm to place carbon markets at the heart of the Copenhagen treaty is matched by growing criticism of the concept, and not just from environmentalists opposed to free market solutions. Peter Voser, Shell's chief executive, has called on governments to introduce a carbon tax or a minimum price for CO² because – as he told the Guardian – the ETS was failing to deliver sufficient incentives to kickstart expensive technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). John Browne, a former boss of BP and an early ETS promoter, has also expressed reservations about such schemes, saying it was \"wrong\" to place all your faith in them. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, warned of the dangers of a \"sub-prime\" crisis inside the ETS if complex financial instruments were created by market participants. The key problem seems to be that ETS carbon prices have remained resolutely low, thwarting low-carbon, high-cost investment. Carbon is currently trading at around $13 a tonne but many believe it needs to be $30, if not $50, to deliver a decisive boost for clean technologies such as wind, solar, CCS and nuclear power. The criticisms of environmentalists such as James Lovelock and Friends of the Earth (FoE) are far more fundamental. The basic charge is that the market has put millions of pounds into the pockets of some without making any real impact on carbon emissions. They accuse governments of being too lenient in the way they drew up the ETS: a cap that was far too loose, too many free permits, too few industries covered and poor monitoring of offset schemes that shift emissions to the developing world. If the carbon price is to rise in the next ETS phase, starting in 2013, much tighter rules will be needed. Henrik Hasselknippe, senior analyst at consultancy Point Carbon, argues the problems have been overplayed and the market – while not operating perfectly – has nonetheless come along way from a standing start. \"Carbon prices have fallen due to the recession,\" said Hasselknippe, adding that he was \"convinced\" that CDMs – clean development mechanism credits created under the Kyoto protocol – have led to real carbon reductions. However, some reports claim that a third to two-thirds of CDMs do not reduce emissions. Alexandria Galin, a policy manager for the Carbon Markets and Investors Association, dismisses suggestions that the market had been taken over by speculators, as claimed by FoE. \"Financial institutions participate in the market largely on behalf of businesses that do not have the capacity or expertise to do it themselves. Furthermore there are no 'complex' instruments creating 'shadow finance',\" she said. Agers agrees, saying his company largely provides advice or trading on behalf of power companies and others who need to hedge their legitimate carbon risks. He admitted that he is in many ways like any other City trader with a decent salary, nice flat and sports car to prove it. But working in the carbon field has rubbed off a little on his lifestyle: he claims to have energy-efficient lightbulbs in his home and to offset the petrol he uses driving his car to watch West Ham football team on a Saturday.

Until that year - as far as we can tell - the number of people who were desperately poor had increased every year since the beginning of time. The number of hungry people rose over time. That changed in 1980, since when - as far as we can tell - the number of people who are desperately poor has decreased every year. Hunger has retreated. Rising food prices currently causing riots from the Philippines to Ethiopia threaten a return to pre-1980 conditions. Preventing this happening is a moral priority, but will not be easy. The causes of declining abject poverty since 1980 are globalisation, and sensible economic policies in China and other Asian states. The absolute number of people living on less than $1 a day is going down for the first time in history. That is cause for celebration. Those celebrations are muted, because many of these people are now living on $2 a day. Still, in normal economic times $2 means an escape from absolute poverty and from malnutrition. But these are not normal times. Although prices have fallen back from their recent record levels, the OECD predicts that food prices will not fall back to previous levels for at least 10 years. The UN's food and agriculture agency agrees. The causes are pretty straightforward. Land is finite, and so if we use less of it for food, or use land for food less efficiently, food supply will fall, prices rise, and someone has to eat less. The last few years have seen us use less land for food, because we decided to use some of it for biofuels. Additionally, increased land for leisure, such as golf courses, cuts food production. And we are using land for food less efficiently, in two ways. Firstly, as we get richer we eat more meat, which (with the exception of battery poultry) is much more land intensive than staple arable crops. With less land available for staple crops - and with the animals eating some of those crops - there are fewer staples for human consumption. Second, as we get richer we start to care more about the more numerous animals we will later eat. We no longer want to eat battery chickens for our Sunday lunch, or even barn-reared chickens. But free-range chickens take up a lot more land per chicken, both because they have more space, and because they take longer to reach any given weight. Food prices go up, and we grumble. Within Britain the affluent moan but do not change their habits: whether a banana is 12p, as it was a year ago, or 18p, as today, doesn't change the number of bananas I eat. Our poor will change their buying habits a little, but the total demand for food from Britain and other rich countries will barely change. But if less is being produced and we are consuming the same, then others must be eating much less. And those others are poor people who are very sensitive to price changes. Rice prices have almost doubled recently, reducing or even eliminating the gain for those whose incomes had risen from $1 to $2. And for those who are still stuck on $1 a day food price rises mean that malnutrition can become an everyday reality. Therefore, we have a choice. We can continue to use land for biofuels, and eat a lot on free-range meat. If we do, the world's poor will eat a lot less, and malnutrition will increase. Or we can combat global warming by nuclear power, eat less meat and have our chickens run around a bit less. We may not like nuclear power, tofu burgers or curtailing our chickens' freedom, but if that is the price we have to pay for fewer children in less developed countries to go to bed hungry, then that, surely, must be a price worth paying. If we make that choice then 2007 will be a temporary hiatus, and global poverty will continue to recede. But if we do not, then 1980-2008 could prove to have been a false dawn for many of the global poor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"theobserver/2010/jan/03/obama-talks-terror-iran-yemen","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-03T00:06:25Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama talks tough on terror as Iran raises nuclear stakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/jan/03/obama-talks-terror-iran-yemen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2010/jan/03/obama-talks-terror-iran-yemen","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama talks tough on terror as Iran raises nuclear stakes","bodyText":"President Barack Obama took on his Republican critics over national security by declaring that the United States remained at war with terrorists and vowing to strike at those behind the Christmas Day airplane bomb attempt. The move marked a dramatic shift in tone from the White House, which has endured a week of withering attacks from Republicans who said it had mismanaged the response to the failed attack. Obama used his weekly radio address to respond to comments by former Vice-President Dick Cheney, accusing him of pretending America was not at war. Obama insisted he had said America was at war from his first day in office: \"On that day, I also made it very clear that our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred, and that we will do whatever it takes to defeat them and defend our country.\" To back up his hard line, Obama also laid the blame for the Christmas Day attack at the lap of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. He said the group had equipped and sent out the Nigerian-bomb bomber Umar Abdulmutallab and would now be brought to justice. \"All those involved in the attempted act of terrorism on Christmas must know: you too will be held to account,\" Obama said. It is unlikely, however, that Obama's stance will do much to appease his Republican critics. America's right wing has been eager to attack him on a range of issues from Iran to Guantánamo Bay to Afghanistan. Yet at the same time Obama is also coming under pressure from the left wing of his own party and liberal groups which see him as continuing too many of the Bush policies. Yemen has now emerged as an unwelcome new front. America has been providing support for the Yemeni government in its battle with Islamic militants, but the country has become more unstable and terrorist attacks from there more frequent. Before the attempted aircraft bombing, a radical Yemeni cleric was also linked to the recent shooting at Fort Hood where a Muslim American killed his fellow soldiers. The issue has been further complicated by the fact that several former Yemeni detainees at Guantánamo Bay have been linked to the recent aircraft attack. Many of the criticisms levelled at Obama have had a strong echo of those that followed 11 September, 2001. Critics have pointed out that much key information was known about the attackers, but had not been co-ordinated among intelligence agencies. Indeed reforms brought in by Bush, such as creating the Department of Homeland Security, may have made the problem worse. \"We are still having the co-ordinating problems that we had before 9/11. There is too much bureaucracy,\" said Ivan Eland, director of the Center on Peace &amp; Liberty at The Independent Institute think-tank. Obama has already ordered a review of procedures for intelligence gathering and information sharing, and will hold a meeting of top staff on Tuesday. In his radio address, he said he would ensure there was more effective co-ordination and that people would be held more accountable for their actions. \"Let us ask the questions that need to be asked. Let us make the changes that need to be made. Let us debate the best way to protect the country we all love,\" he said. One of the few brighter spots in Obama's troubled national security landscape is North Korea. Though relations with the nuclear-armed rogue state are always unpredictable, recent signs point to a potential thaw in relations. A US envoy recently visited the country and Pyongyang's annual New Year's message expressed a desire for a peace treaty with the US and South Korea. ~Iran, however, remains problematic. Tehran's quest for a domestic nuclear programme, and international efforts to prevent it from developing weapons, will this week enter into a new phase of diplomatic brinkmanship. Last week, tens of thousands of supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime demonstrated in Tehran in organised protests against foreign interference in Iran's affairs. Less remarked on was the fact that a deadline for Iran to accept a UN-brokered deal passed on Thursday and raised the prospect of a fresh round of sanctions against Tehran. The country is already under three sets of UN sanctions for its programme of uranium enrichment, the process that can eventually lead to making the key components of an atomic bomb. Instead a senior Iranian figure said the west had just one month to come up with a better deal for it to swap its low-enriched uranium for nuclear fuel. The international community had to decide whether it will accept Iran's conditions, otherwise \"Tehran will enrich uranium to a higher level,\" Manouchehr Mottaki, Iran's foreign minister, was quoted as saying on state television. \"This is an ultimatum,\" he added. Many experts, however, think any resolution to the situation is unlikely. Critics of Tehran have alleged that the regime is using negotiations as a delaying tactic while it pursues its nuclear weapons ambitions. They say that much of the programme remains shrouded in secrecy and doubt the country's stated peaceful intentions, accusing it instead of wanting to build a bomb. Israel, which has been repeatedly threatened by Iran, has said it will not tolerate Iran becoming a nuclear power and Israeli hawks have often raised the prospect of using a military strike to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. Most western diplomats believe such an attack would be a disaster that could ignite a much wider Middle Eastern conflict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/01/india-us-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-01T17:48:21Z","webTitle":"India challenges US over 'measly' climate change efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/01/india-us-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/01/india-us-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"India challenges US over 'measly' climate change efforts","bodyText":"India demanded today that America step up its \"measly\" efforts to combat global warming – or risk jeopardising an international deal to avoid catastrophic climate change. The challenge from Delhi's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, and recent moves from China, mark a deliberate ratcheting up of the pressure on Barack Obama to move more forcefully to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions. It comes barely 24 hours after Democratic leaders introduced a climate change bill in the Senate which – they hoped – would convince the international community that America was prepared for to take strong action. But Ramesh dismissed the bill, which proposes to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, compared to 2005 levels. He said it was too little to persuade India to make serious commitments of its own at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen that aims to seal a global treaty. India – like other major developing countries – has been demanding that rich, industrialised countries pledge cuts of 25% to 40% in Copenhagen in December. \"The bill that was with the Senate yesterday talks about a 20% cut on 2005 levels, which is really only a measly 5% reduction on 1990 levels,\" Ramesh told a US-Indian energy conference in Washington, put on by Yale University and The Energy and Resources Institute in Delhi. He added that America and other developed countries had to commit to deep emissions cuts in the next decade – not by 2050 – if they wanted to see India and China take serious action to contain the rise in their future emissions, as their surging economies expand. \"If we are serious about climate change we should stop talking about 2050. I laugh when countries put up numbers for 2050,\" Ramesh said. However, he was almost immediately rebuffed by Obama's climate change envoy, Todd Stern, who said that such a narrow focus on 2020 actions could wreck the prospects of reaching a deal at Copenhagen. \"We can talk about that all the way to Copenhagen and for the next two or three years and get nothing done,\" Stern said. \"We have to be practical.\" Ramesh's comments were the most forceful expression of a new diplomatic push by India to avoid being cast as the spoiler of the Copenhagen process. Ramesh insisted, however, that India was well aware of the threat posed to its own people by the change in rainfall patterns and rising sea levels brought by climate change. This summer saw the worst monsoon since 1972, a major setback for a country which remains heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture. India sees its economic growth as non-negotiable, given the large number of citizens it wants to lift out of poverty. In the past fortnight, India has offered to undertake a series of measures that would see it embarking on a less polluting course of future growth – but these are firmly tied to action from America. Ramesh spelled out some of those commitments in an interview with the Guardian last week. They include: legislation on fuel efficiency for cars by 2011 and new building efficiency by 2012, getting 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020; and expanding forest cover. India also plans to get 15% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2020. But Ramesh ruled out any possibility that India would agree to an absolute cap on emissions in the future. \"N-O, No,\" he said. The position was endorsed by RK Pachauri, who heads the IPCC. \"Obviously you are not going to ask a country that has 400 million people without a lightbulb in their homes to do the same as a country that has splurge of energy,\" he told the conference.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/jun/07/marketforces","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-06T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"British Energy buoyed by talk of French bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/07/marketforces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jun/07/marketforces","fields":{"headline":"British Energy buoyed by talk of French bid","bodyText":"British Energy, the nuclear power operator, was in demand yesterday in a falling market, up 3p to 735p on talk that France's EDF was preparing to unveil details of a firm bid for the business as early as next week. Last month the company, in which the government owns a 35% stake, revealed it was in talks with several companies about a possible takeover. These discussions were likely to continue for several weeks, it said at the time. Yesterday EDF was reported to be in the throes of arranging an £11.5bn loan to fund the proposed deal. Traders believe EDF is the frontrunner, but it may not have the field to itself. Spain's Iberdrola is another potential bidder, with talk earlier this week of an 885p a share offer, much higher than EDF's suggested offer price of around 680p. Still in the power sector, Scottish &amp; Southern Energy climbed 35p to £15.09 as Morgan Stanley moved from equal weight to overweight and raised its price target by 23% to £17.80. The bank pointed to \"materially improved business prospects\" citing the company's growing share of the energy market. It concluded: \"We see no logic for SSE to trade at a discount to the wider utility sector, or for the shares to have underperformed peers that we think are less well managed, less diversified and with fewer growth options.\" Energy companies were also boosted by another surge in the oil price, which was nudging the record $135 a barrel by the time the London market closed. Traders said the $6 increase in the crude price followed earlier comments from Israel that an attack on Iran was increasingly likely, and accelerated after a fall in the dollar on news that US unemployment had risen at the sharpest rate for 22 years. On top of that, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted oil could reach $150 a barrel by early July. These signs of growing US inflation and declining economic growth unnerved investors, with Wall Street down more than 250 points as London traders packed up to go home. The FTSE 100 ended down 88.5 points to 5906.8, its lowest level since April 14. Fuel cost worries left British Airways 20.75p lower at 233.5p and sent easyJet down 25.75p to 307.5p, while cruise operator Carnival slid 95p to £18.46. But rising crude prices pushed Cairn Energy 116p higher to £33.05, left BG Group 29p better at £12.56 and saw Tullow Oil climb 6.5p to 900.5. The falling dollar helped lift metal prices, and thus mining shares. Xstrata added 145p to £41.07, helped by an upbeat note from Merrill Lynch which raised its price target by 14% to £53. Merrill also said it believed Xstrata was keen to take part in any further industry consolidation, following a failed takeover bid from Brazil's Vale. Iron ore specialist Ferrexpo, which could join the FTSE 100 at next week's quarterly index review, climbed 26.75p to 433.75p. But another potential entrant into the leading index, engineering group Invensys, fell 8.25p to 322p despite a positive note from Landsbanki. Analyst Andrew Carter put a 360p target on the shares, pointing to several pieces of recent news from the company. Its rail division has won a software contract for the Beijing to Tianjin line, as well as an order from Network Rail in Scotland. It is also reportedly close to winning a €600m(£475m) deal in Spain as part of a Thales-led consortium. The financial sector was unnerved by Standard &amp; Poor lowering its ratings on America's troubled monoline insurers MBIA and Ambac. Barclays lost 25.25p to 337.75p and Alliance &amp; Leicester lost 22.25p to 377.25p, while the Royal Bank of Scotland fell 13.5p to 245.5p as its rights issue closed. Lloyds TSB lost 17.25p to 368.25p on news of a possible £180m hit to profits as part of a proposed settlement with the US authorities over payments to blacklisted countries including Iran and Cuba. Standard Life was also among the leading fallers, down 15.5p to 246.75p after Deutsche Bank downgraded from hold to sell and cut its price target from 289p to 266p. It said: \"Though well positioned longer term, Standard Life is in our view one of the most exposed to a tougher UK sales environment near term, particularly in view of the sensitivity of its margins to volumes. On the back of this we lower our new business profit forecast for 2009 by 8%.\" The expected launch of Apple's 3G iPhone should give a boost to Carphone Warehouse, according to Merrill Lynch, which included the company on its list of preferred European telecoms stocks. Carphone closed 6p higher at 243p. But directories group Yell fell 8.25p to 109.25p on continuing fears it may need a rights issue. Lower down the market biotech firm BTG jumped 18.25p to 141.25p after positive trial results for its much trumpeted varicose vein treatment, Varicose. The company is now looking for a marketing partner for the product. Aberdeen Asset Management dipped 2.5p to 134p despite news that Toscafund, the activist investment group headed by Martin Hughes, had raised its holding from 20.02% to 25.49%. Toscafund, which began buying shares in March, is believed to be supportive of the management, rather than planning to force radical change. Finally, Indian oil and gas group Indus made a successful debut on Aim yesterday. The company raised £25m at 164p a share, and closed last night at 203.5p, with traders reporting strong institutional demand for the stock. Merchant of menace Price-comparison website Moneysupermarket.com had a shaky time yesterday. It fell 2.75p to 123.5p early on, following news that the mighty Google had created a financial comparison system called Google Merchant Search. At the moment Google offers only secured loan comparisons but it could easily expand into other areas such as mortgages and insurance. But analyst James Targett at Citigroup said Moneysupermarket's wide range of products - not just loans and mortgages, but insurance, travel and home services - should give it some protection. He said: \"While we do not deny Google will be a credible competitor, [Moneysupermarket's] scale, product reach and brand name position it relatively well versus its smaller competitors. We believe aggressive action from Google could speed up the exit of smaller players.\" With this backing the company's shares closed 2p higher at 128.25p. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2010/may/31/hay-festival-climate-change-debates","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-31T18:59:02Z","webTitle":"Hay festival: 'Climate change is a long struggle' | John Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/31/hay-festival-climate-change-debates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2010/may/31/hay-festival-climate-change-debates","fields":{"headline":"Hay festival: 'Climate change is a long struggle'","bodyText":"For the past four or five years, one theme burned through discussions at Hay more than most: climate change, and the large and small things human beings might do to tackle it.

Just before the summit took place, the so-called \"Climategate\" affair (when emails at the University Of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit were hacked, leading to a flurry of accusations about data manipulation) allowed the sceptics a field day. Immediately afterwards, a dispute about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's work on melting Himalayan glaciers gave them even more encouragement. Recession and the crisis in public finances, too, seemed to hoof climate change well down the world's list of political priorities – while even this year's bitter winter gave the voices of climate-change denial yet another boost. As a result, this year's green Hay sessions have an ever-so-slightly tortured kind of atmosphere, translatable as \"What are we going to do now?\", and are largely devoid of the spurts of tentative optimism that preceded Copenhagen. On Saturday afternoon, the former Energy and Climate Change Secretary – and much-tipped Labour leadership contender – Ed Miliband delivers one of this year's big eco-hits: a video-link conversation with the president of the Maldives, the cluster of islands in the Pacific Ocean that's already dealing with the grim effects of an overheating planet. Mohamed Nasheed, 43, came to office after long years of torture and imprisonment; now he's keen to talk about rising sea and freshly-evacuated islands, and tell people in the Northern Hemisphere what's required of them. \"What we need is large-scale, 60s-style direct action: dynamic street activity,\" he says. \"We need to act very quickly.\" The words rouse the crowd, but there's an uneasiness in the air: right now, are large amounts of \"dynamic street activity\" a realistic possibility? An hour after the event, I meet Miliband. \"When I was here last year,\" he says, \"I did an event with Franny Armstrong [director of the climate change film The Age Of Stupid]. There was high expectation then. Now, there's a sense of\" – he slows down, so as to pick his words carefully – \"sober reality. But I don't think there's a despair. People don't think it's all hopeless. Copenhagen was the crest of a wave, and you inevitably have a bit of a sense of disappointment, and people wanting to gear themselves up again. I think they realise you've got to dig in for a long struggle. That's what it felt like today: people were talking about education, and how we get lots of different people involved – they were taking a long view.\" One all-important question, though: how will people like him once again put jump-leads on the public mood? \"It's a struggle,\" Miliband admits. \"Look: President Nasheed didn't despair. From 1991 to 2008, he was jailed on 13 separate occasions. And as he told us today, he didn't say, 'Oh, I'm giving up now.' You've got to always realise that there is a sense of possibility, and that you do have setbacks on the road. But just because it isn't easy, doesn't mean you give up.\" The day's next green talkfest is a conversation between Rosie Boycott and Nicholas Stern, the economist and life peer who authored 2006's Stern Review, which made the case for cutting our emissions on the basis of hard-headed logic: to do so now would take a tiny fraction of the world's cash and resources, whereas sitting back and then trying to cope with a boiling planet would almost literally cost the Earth. His specialism is a forensic, inevitably rather wonk-ish take on what to do next – underpinned by an optimism that defines just about all his answers. When I suggest that the recession seems to have turned people – and, more importantly, countries – inwards, and squashed the kind of collective thinking we're surely going to need if our emissions levels are even to start coming down, he claims that an economic downturn is the ideal time to push economies in a greener direction. \"This is a special opportunity,\" Stern says. \"If you've got idle resources, the right thing to do is to invest in the growth story of the future – not just reflate the economy in a business-as-usual way. The Koreans' reflation package was about 70% into green activities. With China, it was 25 or 30%. This was an argument that went round the world, and in a few cases, people acted on it.\" So why has climate change apparently disappeared from the political agenda? Again, more glass-half-full stuff: \"It wasn't ever prominent in the election campaign. But one of the reasons for that was that the parties are actually in quite close agreement. It was all there in their manifestos. When David Cameron was putting the coalition together, he said, 'Let's start with what we agree on.' And this was point number two.\" Stern is surely sounding too optimistic for his own good, not least when he chews over Copenhagen's deadening aftermath. \"Life is full of ups and downs. People didn't see, because it was so chaotic and acrimonious, that the Copenhagen accord turned out to be a strong platform for going forward. It was much less fragile than many of us feared. The submissions to Copenhagen now cover 120 countries, and 80% of emissions. If everybody delivers, it will give you emissions levels in 2020 that are the same as we have now. And we'll have peaked. That's really worth having.\" By way of an antidote, I pitch up at an admirably eco-minded hotel in nearby Kington, to meet 91-year-old Professor James Lovelock, on his third trip to the festival. He cuts a fascinating figure here: thanks to the brilliant Gaia Hypothesis (whereby the Earth is seen as a self-regulating system, akin to a living organism), he was one of the first intellectuals to embrace what we now know as green thinking, yet he calmly makes the kind of arguments that send many environmentalists over the edge. At his afternoon event, all is ambivalence: he's received as a hero, but then spends a good deal of his allotted hour taking questions – and mini-speeches – from irate members of the audience. To boil down any of Lovelock's thoughts to a few sentences is to do him a serious disservice, but here goes. As he sees it, climate change is now all but out of control. We should certainly cut our greenhouse-gas emissions, but focus most of our efforts on adapting to a world that, sooner or later, will turn troublesome beyond words. As part of that, he has long claimed the only sustainable method of generating the electricity Britain needs is nuclear power – and that in large swathes of the world, solar and wind power are already proving to be a dangerous distraction. From time to time, he dispenses optimism, of a sort: he's not having the standard-issue predictions of steadily-rising global temperatures, and thinks that though the Earth could suddenly heat up in a way that few models have so far predicted, we might also have longer to prepare than some people think. \"Who knows? Everybody might be wrong,\" he says. \"I may be wrong. Climate change may not happen as fast as we thought, and we may have 1,000 years to sort it out.\" If that sounds comforting, bear in mind that the subtitle of his latest book, The Vanishing Face of Gaia, is \"the final warning\" – and when it comes to the kind of climate change-related schemes that dominate the headlines, he tends to sound withering, to say the least. Copenhagen, he tells me, was not just \"futile\" but \"a monumental extravagance – I'm never convinced that big people-gatherings like that can solve the truly important issues.\" His most dismissive words, however, are reserved for the Stern Review: \"If you mix up some science that's incomplete with some economics which is almost as bad, you're going to get an absolutely dreadful progeny.\" In the context of Hay, Lovelock's most sobering point takes on a grim hilarity. The argument is simple enough: even if the public were to get newly excited, and politicians were united by fresh resolve, the human race might face an insurmountable problem – that even the kind of great minds who come to Hay might not have the IQ required for such a massive challenge. \"The main problem is that we're not really clever enough as a species,\" he says, with a wry look. \"We haven't developed far enough. The Earth's evolving, and we're evolving with it – but it's a damn slow process. It's taken us a million years to change from being semi-intelligent animals to what we are now: still animals, and still semi-intelligent. I don't think we can handle big problems like the Earth.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/feb/03/iraq-inquiry-blair-missile-shield-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-03T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"The lessons of Iraq have been ignored.

The target is now Iran","bodyText":"We were supposed to have learned the lessons of the Iraq war. That's what Britain's Chilcot inquiry is meant to be all about. But the signs from the Middle East are that it could be happening all over again. The US is escalating the military build-up in the Gulf, officials revealed this week, boosting its naval presence and supplying tens of billions of dollars' worth of new weapons systems to allied Arab states. The target is of course Iran. Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain are all taking deliveries of Patriot missile batteries. In Saudi Arabia, Washington is sponsoring a 30,000-strong force to protect oil installations and ports. The UAE alone has bought 80 F16 fighters, and General Petraeus, the US commander, claims it could now \"take out the entire Iranian airforce\". The US insists the growing militarisation is defensive, aimed at deterring Iran, calming Israel and reassuring its allies. But the shift of policy is clear enough. Last week Barack Obama warned that Iran would face \"growing consequences\" for failing to halt its nuclear programme, while linking it with North Korea – as George Bush did, in his \"axis of evil\" speech in 2002. When Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad this week renewed Iran's earlier agreement to ship most of its enriched uranium abroad to be reprocessed, the US was dismissive. Obama's \"outstretched hand\", always combined with the threat of sanctions or worse, appears to have been all but withdrawn. The US vice-president, Joe Biden, underlined that by insisting Iran's leaders were \"sowing the seeds of their own destruction\". And in Israel, which has vowed to take whatever action is necessary to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, threats of war against its allies, Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas, are growing. \"We must recruit the whole world to fight Ahmadinejad,\" Israeli president Shimon Peres declared on Tuesday. The echoes of the run-up to the invasion of Iraq are unmistakable. Just as in 2002-3, we are told that a dictatorial Middle Eastern state is secretly developing weapons of mass destruction, defying UN resolutions, obstructing inspections, threatening its neighbours and supporting terrorism. As in the case of Iraq, no evidence has been produced to back up the WMD claims, though bogus leaks about secret programmes are regularly reproduced in the mainstream press. Most recently, a former CIA official reported that US intelligence believed documents, published in the Times, purporting to show Iran planning to experiment on a \"neutron initiator\" for an atomic weapon, had been forged. Shades of Iraq's non-existent attempts to buy uranium in Niger. In case anyone missed the parallels, Tony Blair hammered them home at the Iraq inquiry last Friday. Far from showing remorse about the bloodshed he helped unleash on the Iraqi people, the former prime minister was allowed to turn what was supposed to be a grilling into a platform for war against Iran. In a timely demonstration that neoconservatism is alive and well and living in London, Blair attempted to use the fact that Iraq had no WMD as part of a case for taking the same approach against Iran. Perceived intention and potential capability were enough to justify war, it turned out. Mentioning Iran 58 times, he explained that the need to \"deal\" with Iran raised \"very similar issues to the ones we are discussing\". You might think that the views of a man that 37% of British people now believe should be put on trial for war crimes would be treated with contempt. But Blair remains the Middle East envoy of the Quartet – the US, UN, EU and Russia – even as he pockets £1m a year from a UAE investment fund currently negotiating a slice of the profits from the exploitation of Iraqi oil reserves. Nor is he alone in pressing the case for war on Iran. Another neocon outrider from the Bush era, Daniel Pipes, wrote this week that the only way for Obama to save his presidency was to \"bomb Iran\" and destroy the country's \"nuclear-weapon capacity\", entailing few politically troublesome US \"boots on the ground\" or casualties. The reality is that such an attack would be potentially even more devastating than the aggression against Iraq. Iran has the ability to deliver armed retaliation, both directly and through its allies, which would not only engulf the region but block the 20% of global oil supplies shipped through the straits of Hormuz. It would also certainly set back the cause of progressive change in Iran. Iran is a divided authoritarian state, now cracking down harshly on the opposition. But it is not a dictatorship in the Saddam Hussein mould. Unlike Iraq, Israel, the US and Britain, Iran has not invaded and occupied anybody's territory, but has the troops of two hostile, nuclear-armed powers on its borders. And for all Ahmadinejad's inflammatory rhetoric, it is the nuclear-armed US and Israel that maintain the option of an attack on Iran, not the other way round. Nor has the UN nuclear agency, the IAEA, found any evidence that Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons, while the US's own national intelligence estimate found that suspected work on a weapons programme had stopped in 2003, though that may now be adjusted in the new climate. Iran's leadership has long insisted it does not want nuclear weapons, even while many suspect it may be trying to become a threshold nuclear power, able to produce weapons if threatened. Given the recent history of the region, that would hardly be surprising. For the US government, as during the Bush administration, the real problem is Iran's independent power in the most sensitive region in the world – heightened by the Iraq war. The signals coming out of Washington are mixed. The head of US National Intelligence implied on Tuesday there was nothing the US could do to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons if it chose to do so. Perhaps the military build-up in the Gulf is just sabre rattling. The preference is clearly for regime change rather than war. But Israel is most unlikely to roll over if that option fails, and the risks of the US and its allies, including Britain, being drawn into the fallout from any attack would be high. As was discovered in the case of Iraq, the views of outriders like Blair and Pipes can quickly become mainstream. If we are to avoid a replay of that catastrophe, pressure to prevent war with Iran will have to start now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2008/may/16/britishenergygroupbusiness.utilities","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-16T16:04:43Z","webTitle":"British Energy receives string of bids","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/16/britishenergygroupbusiness.utilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/may/16/britishenergygroupbusiness.utilities","fields":{"headline":"British Energy receives string of bids","bodyText":"Shares in British Energy rose 5% today after the nuclear generator said it had received a series of proposals from its string of suitors, including some pitched above yesterday's 680p closing price. The company said: \"There can be no certainty that any of the proposals will lead to an offer being made for the company nor as to the terms on which any offer would be made.\" However the prospect of a bid battle for British Energy sparked a rally in the shares which rose 35.5p to 715.5p today, valuing the company, where the government has a 35% stake, at about £11.5bn. Last month the shares hit an all time high of 785p on the back of City expectations of a battle for control of the group. However the price had subsequently fallen back amid a growing belief that EDF was the most likely bidder. \"This weakness in the price has been because people thought it would only be EDF,\" according to Evolution Securities' analyst, Lakis Athanasiou. \"The key today is that there are a number of players.\" The company has been in the bid spotlight since the government backed a new generation of nuclear power stations to ensure Britain has a broad portfolio of electricity generation. According to a report today the bid approaches have come from EDF and Suez of France, and a combination of Germany's RWE and Iberdrola of Spain. Suez subsequently denied it had made an approach. The other companies have yet to comment publicly.

On Tuesday afternoon, set against the sleek backdrop of a London hotel, the vice-chairman of Iraq's oil and gas committee, Abdul-Hadi al-Hassani, told the BBC that the time is right to invest in Iraq as the government has \"gone from strength to strength\". A short distance across town, Sir John Scarlett, head of MI6 and gatekeeper to some of the precious \"intelligence\" that triggered the war, refused to confirm or deny the report that an Iraqi taxi driver was responsible for the \"45 minutes\" WMD claim. While the future and the past of Iraq were being discussed in London, Baghdad was burning in the present, as fire engines were still dousing the smouldering car wrecks and the ambulances were still carefully collecting the remains of some of the 127 people who had been blown up in the co-ordinated blasts that hit the capital. Despite the progress in reducing levels of violence, clearly Iraq remains a highly dangerous and significantly underdeveloped place. In the first six months of this year only 25,000 Iraqis returned to the country and 4.6 million Iraqis remain internally and externally displaced. In the past six years the country's scores on press freedom and corruption perception indexes have got worse. February's statistics showed only 20% of Iraqis have access to sewage and 45% clean water. Iraq may have turned a corner and be heading in the right direction but there is still a long way to go. For real change and development to occur Iraq's oil will clearly play a major role. The country currently produces 2.5m barrels a day (down from the 2.8m prior to the invasion) accounting for some 90% of the government's budget. With little fanfare the second round of bidding for Iraq's oilfields is taking place this month, and a consortium led by Shell has now secured rights to develop the giant Majnoon oilfield. While diplomats seek to save the world in Copenhagen, this more traditional conference will seek to award concessions parcelling out the country with the third largest oil reserves, home to an estimated 115bn barrels of oil. Oil minister Hussain al-Shahristani has estimated that with $50bn investment in infrastructural upgrades, Iraq will be able to produce 6m barrels a day by 2017. However, the first round of oil bidding back in June turned out to be a bit of a disaster, with the major oil companies demanding far more for every barrel produced than the $2 offered by the Iraqis. Ironically for those who argued that the war was all about oil, the Chinese were part of the only concession to be agreed. A consortium of the China National Petroleum Corporation and BP signed a 20-year deal, promising to keep expenses down using low-cost Chinese labour and equipment. Many Iraqis were dismayed by the length of such contracts that \"will put the Iraqi economy in chains and shackle its independence for the next 20 years. They squander Iraq's revenues.\" Oil has been something of a curse in the Iraq's history, bringing with it greater levels of foreign interference and a history of governments who can exploit the theory of \"no representation without taxation\". There is a clear precedent for the dangers of rentierism found in the neighbouring states of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In 1925 the Iraqi parliament ratified an oil concession agreement with the Turkish Petroleum Company, later to become the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), on terms most unfavourable to itself. By 1953 oil accounted for 49.3% of national income, although both production and prices were controlled by the IPC. In 1961 Abd al-Karim Qasim's famous Law 80 reclaimed unexploited areas of the IPC concession but it was only in 1972 that the industry was fully nationalised. The subsequent oil crisis of 1973 sent prices through the roof, greatly enhancing the power of the state and emboldening Saddam Hussein who would lead the country into disastrous wars with Iran and the Kuwait. In March 2003 Paul Wolfowitz, then the deputy US defence secretary, said that Iraq could finance its own post-war construction and famously the oil ministry was one of the few buildings to be protected after the fall of Saddam. While the failure of the neocons to predict what would happen in post-invasion Iraq is well documented, the future of the role of oil in Iraq is far from sure. Already what appears to be a multitude of \"white elephants\" are in the pipeline. A country that can barely feed and secure its own people and has been fighting back outbreaks of cholera is looking to build a mass transit system in Baghdad, a big wheel in the style of the London Eye, purchase F-16 warplanes and – more ominously considering the unpredictability of the region – nuclear power stations. Oil, in conjunction with all this unaccountable spending, may retard the chequered growth of Iraqi democracy. The fact that senior Iraqi government figures are offering oil concessions despite the failure to agree on a national hydrocarbon law is a case in point. Hassani awkwardly explained this week how they were reverting to laws passed in Saddam's time instead in order to encourage investment. With elections now scheduled for March it remains to be seen whether the present Iraqi government has enough vision or strength to avoid the temptations of short-term gain over securing longer-term interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2010/sep/04/marine-court-iain-sinclair-leonards","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-03T23:06:16Z","webTitle":"Marine Court: Hymn to the Sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/sep/04/marine-court-iain-sinclair-leonards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2010/sep/04/marine-court-iain-sinclair-leonards","fields":{"headline":"Marine Court: Hymn to the Sun","bodyText":"Just before 7am on the morning of 20 July 2010, a number of passengers disembark from a beached concrete liner and shuffle through the shallows of St Leonards-on-Sea, to foregather and huddle, as with all nautical disasters, while they wait for the lifeboat. Which arrives in the form of a world-weary charabanc. They are head-counted, eased into tight slots for the bumpy ride down the coast to Newhaven. Where they will clamber aboard the MV Balmoral for a day's voyage to Tower Bridge, by way of Beachy Head. As they put out into a glassy sea, familiar topographical markers are set aside. A steward, staggering to balance a tray of liquid refreshment and burger refills for the captain, tells an inquirer that Canvey Island is Tilbury. Every time we steer in close enough to inspect a natural wonder – the white cliffs of Dover or the Dungeness nuclear power station – our vessel tilts, alarmingly, as 650 cameras whirr and click. Seen from the shore, it must seem a miracle that we stay afloat. The crowded deck is like an out-take from Otto Preminger's Exodus. Quayside at Newhaven, embarkation feels like evolution going into reverse, primitive life forms rushing back to the ocean. Standing room only, queues for the breakfast bar snaking up the stairs and twice round the deck. The recklessly abandoned St Leonards boat-building, on the other hand, its design based on the Queen Mary, has plenty of room for a decayed first class of freeholders, with an ever-shifting ballast of rentals in steerage, tucked away in the old servants' quarters at the rear. Marine Court looks big enough to rehouse Hackney. Superstructure burdened with a forest of radio masts and photovoltaic scanners, this prewar monster looms over the remnants of James Burton's 1820s colonnades, at a slight angle, like a stack of dirty plates from a wedding breakfast in the Royal Victoria hotel. You can picture the unstable reef tilting in the wind, which surges around shops embedded in its hull with enough force to repel retirees at the window of the showroom where they stock an infinite variety of furniture to die in. Marine Court, which should never have been given a berth, stealing light from steep hillside terraces, has the dignity of an old circus elephant. With the passage of time, it has become a geological feature. And one of the glories of the south coast. The only other such building in the world, a luxury hotel based on the Queen Mary's competitor in the blue-ribbon Atlantic trade, the SS Normandie, is to be found in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Fringed by trees, proud against a permanently blue sky, the sleek curves of the hotel and the dazzling whiteness of its balconies demonstrate everything Marine Court is not; but what, with care (and serious investment), it could become. The Normandie hotel, in streamline moderne style, was conceived by the engineer Félix Benítez as a loving tribute to his French wife, Moineau, whom he met, in Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers fashion, on an ocean voyage. The rival concrete liners were launched at the same moment, 1938. The Normandie hotel accrued the glamour of a Cuban resort for high-rollers out of The Godfather, while Marine Court, undone by war, boarded by pirates, declined into a set for The Shining. A haunted hangar in which to house a crazed writer, hammering out the same sentence, over and over, while he waits to join the undead in a decommissioned cocktail bar. A good scattering of Marine Courters were aboard the Balmoral that morning. I had never seen so many in one place. On winter stays in the building, I encountered no other human presence: antique grille-fronted lifts groaned, furred pipes complained. Hot water resisted every inch of the way to chromium-plated bathrooms. Endless corridors, viewed through diamond-shaped portholes, were low-lit and unpeopled – at least by anything you could see or touch. Monitor screens in the mirrored lobby, with its chequerboard floor, played back drifts of aquarium light. Panels were as blank as if wiped by a vampire. An occasional porter, left over from another era, creaked through, with a nod and a tug at the cuffs of a threadbare uniform. I was frozen in my tracks by the approach of a figure in black T-shirt and baggy tracksuit bottoms, up there on the monitor screen: a memory-spectre, from an erased chapter of my life, come back from the aether. I hadn't set eyes on Ranald Graham since our student days in Dublin, 40 years before. His flat, at the top of the building, was insulated in unshelved countercultural paperbacks and olive-green copies of Paris-published Burroughs. Along with mounds of plays and film scripts, made and unmade. There had been an afterlife, so he explained, of television production, The Sweeney, Dempsey and Makepeace, strategically funded programmers in Hong Kong. There were adventures in Hollywood too, including the screenplay for William Castle's last film, Shanks, made in 1974 and generally acknowledged as the weirdest project ever to emerge from a major studio. The white-face mime Marcel Marceau plays a dual role, as a scientist trying to reanimate dead animals and a puppeteer assisting with the experiments. The puppeteer releases zombies to jerk and twitch on missions of vengeance. After that, there was nowhere to go. Except Marine Court. The ship of fools where lost souls are always welcome. Ranald was gregarious, a lovely teller of tales. He took an active part in the gambling school, predicting football scores, at £2 a hit, in the minimart on the corner. And he nursed the ambition to complete the ultimate horror script, the one he had been cooking for so many years. He was hammering at his laptop when he heard a rap at the window. A figure, naked to the waist, punctured by needles like a refugee from Hellraiser, stared in at him. And beckoned. He roared, he rushed. The barefoot man lurched away into the darkness. He was the living proof of my conviction that this building incubates narrative. Stories tell us, not us them, while we listen to the drag of pebbles on the tide, and become absorbed in the great fact of the English Channel. But there was a rational explanation for the spook at his window. A poor creature, suffering and medicated, in another flat on another floor, had become disorientated, and was roaming the balconies trying to find a safe door. The accidental fraternity of Marine Court, gathering on the deck of the Balmoral, like Aleister Crowley's coven up on the ridge in Hastings, were drawn together. We were there for a reason. We had the powerful atavistic urge to view our concrete liner from the sea, to achieve a reverse angle that would confer on the peeling leviathan the gravitas it deserved. Distance, in this case, was time. From seven miles out, as we stared at the hazy coastline from alongside the Royal Sovereign lighthouse, Marine Court shone with the brilliance of its launch as a modernist fantasy, a pleasure palace conceived in the spirit of Agatha Christie. With art deco restaurants, tea rooms, Turkish baths and \"fittings worthy of a West End mansion\". Kevin, who rented a flat in the building and who loved everything about it, introduced himself. He carried digital equipment with which to assemble, as he confessed, a feature-length account of our voyage. His camera privileged Marine Court in a way denied to the human eye. It became what it had ceased to be in the real world, a paradigm of south-coast regeneration; a 600ft, 13-storey wonder. Kevin explained that he tended to stay indoors, on his balcony, after work. He was a big man and too many of the street folk of London Road knew him from his day job as a security guard at Morrisons. One enterprising local had been captured with 12 bottles of Baileys secreted inside his overcoat. Experiencing a temporary estrangement from Hackney, I walked around the coast, in the opposite direction to the Balmoral, to search for a place that would fire my imagination. After Whitstable, Margate, Deal, Dover, Pevensey Bay, Eastbourne and Brighton, I gave it up. Until the photographer Effie Paleologou invited me down to Hastings for a talk she was giving about a commission, to depict the town at night. Like Ranald Graham, she stumbled into a landscape of astonishing eccentrics, whispering voices hungry for the right ventriloquist. The beauty of the thing was that she absorbed all this, without patronage or exploitation, and produced a series of exquisitely graded minimalist prints, with not a breath of human interference. A leakage of sour neon against dying natural light. She led our group on a walk through the flower-dressed alleys of the Old Town. Characterful houses were still to be had at modest prices. This quarter, and some of its denizens, twinned with the Hampstead of the 1960s. St Leonards, a mile or so to the west, and a much more comfortable fit, was Hackney-on-Sea. Asylum seekers and economic migrants, in melancholy limbo, sat on the pebbles or hitched themselves to the rail, while they waited for bad news. I saw, with a sense of awful inevitability, a photograph of Marine Court. A cursory viewing was enough, the way that you could lie in bed with nothing but sea and sky outside the window, through that CinemaScope frame of rusting rails. It was going to be tough to live up to the challenge of the wraparound view, angular balconies and curved decks. The promenade running away to the funland arcades, the fishermen's huts like extended sentry boxes. With a roar of Nietzschean overdrive, the concrete superliner of Marine Court was topped out and ready for the champagne bottle in 1938, two years after work had begun. The promotional brochure was a silver-stamped work of art. It referred to our building as a \"Hymn to the Sun\". As with the trip on the Balmoral, the brochure speaks of anchoring a mile from shore, to appreciate how the dominant features of the bay were now the Norman castle and Marine Court. Properties left over from the original (and decaying) Burton estate were acquired by an astute estate agent, Commander Bray. The borough engineer Sidney Little had the vision of a concrete city, a marine metropolis, stretching from Hastings to Bexhill, with the boat-building of architects Kenneth Dalgleish and Roger Pullen as the flagship. The promenade made a chain of visual connections between underpasses, shelters, sunken gardens and the spectacular Olympic-size lido at Bulverhythe. Sensuous railway posters celebrated this English Riviera, its bathing beauties and lotus eaters basking in sun lounges below Marine Court. Within a year, the dream was over. The developer had been carried away, as were so many others, by the concept of a beached cruise liner: the suspension of time and dissolution of space. Residential take-up was disappointing. The developers folded with debts of £333,000 (at a period when a pleasant three-bed semi in the town could be had for £750). War was declared. Marine Court was requisitioned, to be occupied by airmen and cypher clerks. A German fighter-bomber, seeing it as a legitimate target, blew away three floors at the prow. Sidney Little's underground car parks now looked like an anticipation of bunker architecture. The rest of the story is showroom, casino, Witch Doctor disco, unexplained fires, drug rehabilitation unit. Subterranean space was rented to a Nigerian pastor-solicitor, Michael Adelasoye, who was later found guilty of involvement in helping to arrange 383 sham marriages. Adelasoye operated in partnership with a Ukrainian man extradited from Sweden for drug offences and a local vicar with a large church and a very small congregation. At first, there were regular refits and paint jobs; by the time of the new millennium, Marine Court was crumbling away. Managing agents declared themselves bankrupt. Services collapsed. One lady, driven to the point of breakdown, turned on her taps and left them running, until all the water in the building's system was drained. A brave and determined group decided to apply for enfranchisement, to take over the freehold. After a protracted series of court battles, they succeeded. The old Marine Court magic, despite all evidence to the contrary, is happening again: an onboard democracy based on unreasoning love. Street-level shops are active once more and catering to incomers. The building is no elegant Bauhaus translation, but a steampunk generator of nautical fantasies. I smiled when the man in the curry house, under the canopy, told me that Lord Longford was a regular and that the Walker Brothers were always dropping in. Then he produced the album. And here they are, with poppadoms and Cobra lager, snapped by the ship's photographer. Late immortals comfortably settled in a corner for the cruise that never ends.

Since then, and in direct response to our criticism, more rational elements in the party have made an effort to reform policy in a number of areas to ensure that it has a scientific basis. Have their efforts paid off? The Green party manifesto is considerably more polished than last year's, with a focus on radical left policies centred on community, \"fairness\" and of course the environment. Radical action on climate change is promised, with the party pushing for reductions in CO2 emissions of 10% a year, achieved mostly through punitive measures against businesses such as heavy taxation on water consumption and air travel. In fact, reading their policies on climate is like being faced with a sort of \"anti-Ukip\", and in many ways – while well-intentioned – equally unrealistic. On a more positive note, the Greens are excellent on drugs policy, and it is refreshing to see a party highlighting the issue of managing Britain's water supplies, a problem that is likely to loom much larger in the future. So how do they score on our questions? Brian Cox: Science funding Do you plan to maintain Britain's science budget below the European average? The Greens admit, refreshingly, that they don't yet know what they would spend on scientific research, and focus instead on a \"radical commitment\" to jobs in high-tech manufacturing and research as part of their wider, ambitious plans to reshape the economy into a nicer, greener form. This isn't an analysis of economic policy, which I suspect is a good thing for the Greens, but certainly they appear to understand the importance of science and technology to Britain's future prosperity. Alternative medicine If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo, should it be supported by the NHS? In a welcome U-turn since last year, Redding states that, \"Our policy is that any medicine or treatment available on the NHS should be backed up by scientific evidence.\" Their manifesto uses rather more compromising language, likely reflecting the internal debates in the party over this policy over the past year, pledging to, \"make available on the NHS complementary medicines that are cost-effective and have been shown to work.\" Which is pretty much none of them. Interestingly, they also seek to reform the labelling of medicines, with a pledge to make sure they carry an accurate list of all ingredients. Presumably homeopathic remedies would carry a blank label. Simon Singh: Libel reform What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science? Currently there is no statutory public interest defence, so scientists risk running the gauntlet of London's High Court if they publish material they believe to be in the public interest, but that a major corporation or litigious charlatan believes to be libellous. Party leader Caroline Lucas is herself a signatory to the Libel Reform Campaign pledge, so no problems here. Climate change/Energy Should nuclear power be part of our country's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions? How soon can we bring new plants online? The Greens energy policy is noble, and I would love to believe that it could happen, but the idea of making a 65% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020 through energy efficiency and renewable energy projects alone seems far-fetched. Unlike the Liberal Democrats, the Greens' dislike for nuclear energy is ideological, but both parties would benefit from presenting a clearer, realistic analysis of how such ambitious targets would be achieved. David Nutt: Drugs policy To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence? What evidence, if any, would you require to declassify a drug? Drug policy is the highlight of the Green manifesto, and by far their strongest policy area. Their approach is based on the recognition that drug harm is ultimately a public health problem, not a criminal issue. The Greens also understand that prohibition itself can cause harm, which logically leads to an evidence-based policy of weighing up \"any possible health risks from a particular substance against the social harm of criminalising, for example, millions of cannabis users\". Campaigners have noted that the Greens, and the Lib Dems, have slightly watered down some of their views on drug policy for their manifestos. They should trust the public and be bold. Animal testing Is animal testing necessary? Are the ethical concerns outweighed by the benefits? How would you like to see regulations on animal testing change under your government, if at all? The same can't be said for their policies on animal testing, which remain an unmitigated disaster. While we're all entitled to our ethical opinions, the party continues to make statements that are about as grounded in reality as Narnia, from the baseless assertion that animal testing somehow increases the risk of adverse reactions in medicine, to the persistent myth that researchers are not interested in better, cheaper alternatives. There's also a worrying failure to understand that animal research is not simply used for drug testing, but is the foundation of basic biomedical research. Immunology would barely exist as a research discipline without a ready supply of lab mice. As blogger Gimpy puts it: \"They have no understanding of scientific research or medicine.\" Incidentally, the \"independent patient safety organisation\" referred to in the Greens' answer – the Safer Medicines Trust – lists Green party leader Caroline Lucas MEP among its patrons. Independent? Petra Boynton: Public health How will your party ensure public health/education campaigns are underpinned by evidence, and how will you evaluate their success? PR companies are increasingly influential in directing both the content and delivery of public campaigns, frequently at the expense of expertise from scientists, healthcare providers and academics. \"Campaigns should be piloted and evaluated, using comparative before-and-after surveys or other means of measuring public awareness, and rolled out to wider populations only if shown to be effective.\" With this statement, the Greens join a rapidly emerging cross-party consensus on evidence-based public health campaigns. Genetic engineering/Stem cell research Should Britain be at the forefront of research in these areas? What benefits do you believe such research will bring for society? Happy with stem cell research, the Greens maintain an ideological objection to GM crops. To be fair, they have made some progress since last year in distinguishing between GM crops and wider GM research, which they are happy to let continue. But as with animal testing, the party seems to be in thrall to scientifically illiterate activists. There are of course some genuine concerns over the behaviour of companies like Monsanto, and there will always be a need to scrutinise claims made for new technologies, but increasingly elements of the Green movement – notably Greenpeace – have adopted a hysterical and unscientific tone on GM food that misinforms the public and prevents sensible debate. The party would do well to step back and engage with independent scientists to improve its understanding of current research. Ben Goldacre: Pharmaceutical regulation Do you believe pharmaceutical companies should be forced to publish all the research data they have on the potential benefits and harms of drugs they manufacture? The Greens go further, and state that all scientific research institutions should publish all relevant research data – a nice idea in theory, although see the caveats I mentioned in my response to Ukip earlier in the week. The declaration that in order to open up drug production in poorer nations \"[drug design] information should be regarded as public property not commercial data\" needs considerable clarification. Drug development may cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and Greens should aim to work with pharmaceutical companies to come up with something fair to all parties, rather than simply demanding that they hand over expensive commercial data to competitors. Conclusion Their policy in some areas is excellent, and it's tempting to be generous to the Greens. As a party they're well intentioned and admit that they are in the midst of a process of reform: \"We have recently completed a radical overhaul of our health policies which was extremely encouraging. This saw us adopt far stronger policies in areas like complementary therapies and stem cell research and we're intending to approach the science and technology chapters of our policies in the same constructive fashion.\" Unfortunately that reform hasn't come quickly enough for this election, and it remains to be seen how entrenched the bad science in areas such as animal testing and GM really is. A lot of work still needs to be done to make the Green party electable on science issues, and it needs to engage with the scientific community to get a much more realistic and balanced understanding of modern science. Progress has been made, and party members like Redding deserve respect for their achievements so far, but they have a long way to go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2010/may/03/science-labour-election","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-03T08:18:16Z","webTitle":"Science: Another excellent reason to ditch Labour on Thursday | Martin Robbins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/may/03/science-labour-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2010/may/03/science-labour-election","fields":{"headline":"Science: Another excellent reason to ditch Labour on Thursday","bodyText":"We all remember John Prescott dancing – well, wobbling – to D:Ream's election anthem Things Can Only Get Better as Labour was swept into power in 1997. Thirteen years later the band's keyboard player, Brian Cox, has become a professor of physics and passionate science activist, and leads a small army of scientists and science advocates who are fed up with the party after a series of very public rows about things such as drug policy and science funding. Has Labour learned from its mistakes? As with the Conservatives, Labour's manifesto places great emphasis on linking science with business, and indeed its responses to our questions came from business minister Pat McFadden, rather than science minister Lord Drayson. One promised initiative would seek to increase the supply of science and technology graduates, creating what Labour calls a \"technician class\" providing employees for hi-tech industry. In terms of its broad approach to the position of science in society, it's difficult to find air between Labour and the Tories. Brian Cox: Science funding Do you plan to maintain Britain's science budget below the European average? Two questionable statements are made in Labour's response to our question. First, the suggestion that the debate is no longer about saving British science is an arrogant one that dismisses serious concerns in the research community. Second, the assertion that \"investment in science and research\" has doubled in real terms is highly dependent on what figures you include, and ignores the fact that spending as a proportion of GDP has remained static. Research continues to be something that is paid for out of the Treasury's loose change. Past record aside, Labour's pledges are as vague as those of the other parties, with no manifesto commitment to preserve the science budget. Science funding will be ring-fenced, but we don't know how big the enclosure will be. Alternative medicine If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo, should it be supported by the NHS? The Department of Health has yet to give its response to the Science and Technology Select Committee's damning report on homeopathy, but under a Labour government its views would apparently be irrelevant. Labour states that it would not take a line on alternative medicine, but would rather leave the decision to local trusts. A revealing comment is that \"the availability of suitably qualified/regulated practitioners\" would be taken into account in decisions on the provision of treatments. Labour has been active in promoting the creation of alternative medicine quangos in the past few years, which means it is helping to give credibility to quacks and increasing their chances of infiltrating our health services. The fact that hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money have been poured into alt med lobby groups like Prince Charles' Foundation for Integrated Health – now defunct after being involved in fraud and under investigation by the Charity Commission – raises serious questions about ministers' judgement. Simon Singh: Libel What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science? Nothing controversial here, with Labour part of the cross-party consensus on libel reform. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the British Chiropractic Association for its generous sacrifice in making reform of our libel laws possible. Climate change/Energy Should nuclear power be part of our country's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions? How soon can we bring new plants online? In contrast to all the other parties, Labour provides very specific and credible plans for energy, although of course it has greater access to the necessary information. Increased nuclear capacity would begin to come online by 2018 (although the cost of this is not mentioned), with a target for 15% of energy to come from renewables by 2020, including plans to construct up to 6,400 new offshore wind turbines. Labour also demonstrates an understanding of the economic rewards to be reaped from turning Britain into a world-leading centre for green technology, with a particular emphasis on marine and tidal energy. David Nutt: Drug policy To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence? What evidence, if any, would you require to declassify a drug? \"It is for government to consider that advice and then to make policy decisions taking into account all relevant factors.\" In saying this, Labour demonstrates that it has not understood the criticism it received after Nutt-gate, and positions itself firmly alongside the Conservatives in believing that no amount of evidence can ever trump political ideology. What makes this an even more bitter pill to swallow for many on the left is that Labour's political ideology in this area appears to be the same social conservatism as that of the Tory party. Animal testing Is animal testing necessary? Are the ethical concerns outweighed by the benefits? How would you like to see regulations on animal testing change under your government, if at all? As with the other major parties, Labour supports animal testing and understands its necessity, correctly pointing out that \"no validated and established laboratory methods are available to totally replace animal experimentation.\" It is also worth mentioning Labour's decent record in this area, with a ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals, and the protection of great apes. Petra Boynton: Public health How will your party ensure public health/education campaigns are underpinned by evidence, and how will you evaluate their success? Labour is good at making the right noises on public health campaigns: \"We have put in place tough performance targets in key areas like childhood obesity and the success of interventions is monitored closely. We also track performance in areas like smoking cessation.\" The problem is that targets and performance measures aren't necessarily the same as properly controlled trials of the sort that the Lib Dems and Conservatives propose, and it's hard for independent researchers to evaluate their success if methodology and data are not openly published. While the other main parties are looking at policy improvements in this area, Labour seems happy to continue with the status quo, which is disappointing. Ben Goldacre: Pharmaceutical regulation Do you believe pharmaceutical companies should be forced to publish all the research data they have on the potential benefits and harms of drugs they manufacture? \"A Labour government will always keep an open mind on the publication of data from this sector where there is strong public interest, but we have no immediate plans to force this type of disclosure.\" When is the disclosure of information about the efficacy of drugs not strongly in the public interest? A disappointing answer, once again indistinguishable from the Tory position, which gives a free pass to pharmaceutical companies. Conclusions On the positive side, we have reasonably coherent and detailed plans for tackling climate change and building up energy security over the next 10 years. Labour also joins a broad political consensus on GM technology, stem cell research, libel reform and animal testing; and it is no worse than the other parties when it comes to the future of science funding. The problems are many, and can be clumped into two broad groups. The first group includes science funding, drug policy and pharmaceutical regulation, where Labour's approach seems virtually indistinguishable from Conservative policy. In fact it's notable that if you take many of Labour's answers, you would be hard-pressed to tell which party they came from. It takes a remarkably pro-business line, which manifests itself in a refusal to put proper scrutiny on pharmaceutical companies, and an attitude that seems to regard science as almost a subset of business. Meanwhile on drugs, we are faced with another potential government that believes the ignorant views of Daily Mail columnists should be considered on a level with expert scientific advice. Then we have the disappointment of Labour's policies on public health and alternative medicine, which both seem to be \"carry on as before\" in spite of voluminous evidence and criticism suggesting that this is not a sensible approach. The problem with Labour isn't its previous record on science. We all make bad decisions, and so do governments, but the measure of a good government should be its ability to learn from its mistakes, and improve policy accordingly. The problem is, quite simply, that it hasn't. And so, for many, science has become yet another reason to desert Labour. Best candidate Andrew Lomas, candidate for Wycombe, is tackling a PhD in cancer biology and drug design, but finds time to engage with science activists. He challenged his party's treatment of David Nutt, and described homeopathy as \"a stinking pile of uselessness\". Worst candidate Alan Johnson. While arguably a number of Labour MPs hold even more worrying views, his treatment of Nutt epitomised the clash between science and ideology in politics in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/sep/25/gordon-brown-tories-cameron-g20","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-25T22:18:33Z","webTitle":"Tories isolated as Britain leads the way, says Gordon Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/25/gordon-brown-tories-cameron-g20","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/sep/25/gordon-brown-tories-cameron-g20","fields":{"headline":"Tories isolated as Britain leads the way, says Gordon Brown","bodyText":"A determined if frustrated Gordon Brown today insisted Britain was at the centre of efforts to resolve the major issues facing the world as he sought to contrast his judgment on foreign and economic policy with that of David Cameron's. Brown unusually used a press conference at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh to claim the Tories had made the wrong calls on economic strategy over the past year and now stood isolated from the international community in their opposition to a fiscal stimulus. Brown was speaking after he held a hastily arranged bilateral meeting with President Barack Obama at the start of the summit. The meeting was called after press reports that Brown had five times sought such a meeting and had been spurned by an overstretched Obama. The White House dismissed the reports as media-generated silliness, but quickly rejigged Obama's programme to give Brown a formal meeting and so dispel any suggestion of a snub. Following the meeting, Brown referred to nuclear disarmament, climate change, and the economy before saying that \"around the world, newspapers and journals are reporting these as the big issues that have to be dealt with, and I intend fully to continue the work and concentrate on these big issues. I think Britain is at the heart of dealing with these big problems.\" Giving a resilient and sometimes punchy performance, following a week in which critics have questioned his health, eyesight and waning influence, Brown told reporters they needed to learn how big international meetings work – pointing out that he was sitting alongside Obama the whole time. Yesterday's brief meeting had initially been arranged for after the summit, but it was brought forward when Obama found space in his schedule. Brown and Obama also appeared together on stage at an early morning press conference in solidarity against Iran alongside the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, reflecting the degree to which the three countries' intelligence agencies have been involved in unmasking Iranian subterfuge on nuclear power. Brown also claimed that world leaders saw that British proposals for a climate-change technology transfer fund would lie at the heart of any eventual agreement on climate change at Copenhagen. Brown's aides insist he has been leading from the front on climate change, and say his proposal that world leaders should be prepared to go to Copenhagen to break the deadlock is gathering support. Brown, eager for a springboard for next week's Labour conference, played on his experience and knowledge of global economic policy to claim he had played the central role in shaping many of the issues over the past four days, implying a Conservative government would leave Britain isolated and reduced in influence. He said : \"The big debate today that will start this morning is, do you continue the monetary and fiscal stimulus? Every country round the world is telling me that we have got to continue this stimulus. Some countries are putting in more money next year than this year. \"The view in Britain on the other side of the political divide is that we should stop it now and in fact we should have stopped it a long time ago. That would have meant more job losses, higher debt, and more businesses would have gone under. These are big, big judgments of economic policy that we have to take.\" He acknowledged that the state of the economy would be a crucial issue in his forthcoming general election battle with the Conservatives, but said voters would look to people that made the right judgment. \"I think what people are saying is that until they can see the results of all the action we have taken in getting the economy back to recovery, they have suspended judgment,\" he said. \"I accept that I have got to show people that the action that we have taken is bringing results and will bring greater results in the months to come.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/blog/2008/may/29/nuclearpoweryespleaseorno","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-29T11:10:15Z","webTitle":"Brown goes nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/may/29/nuclearpoweryespleaseorno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/blog/2008/may/29/nuclearpoweryespleaseorno","fields":{"headline":"Brown goes nuclear","bodyText":"Problems at Britain's clapped-out nuclear power plants contributed to serious blackouts this week. Gordon Brown wants even more new nuclear power stations than planned - but is he right? The prime minister's new proposal for still more nuclear plants is enthusiastically endorsed by the Murdoch papers. The Times says \"nuclear has a huge part to play\" in solving what it describes as Britain's \"energy crisis\". The Sun declares that Brown is ATOMIC SMITTEN, which also sums up the paper's stance. In an editorial reading like a memo from the cartoon power plant run by Mr Burns in the Simpsons, the Sun says: \"The PM says he has ambitious plans that involve more than simply replacing our 14 nuclear plants. Excellent. Now all we need is for Mr Brown to come up with details and a timetable.\" But the Guardian has much gloomier news for the nuclear industry and its leading company, British Energy. It reports that \"mishaps\" over the last two days left more than 60% of British Energy's capacity out of action. A closure at Hunterston, in Scotland, yesterday followed a shutdown at Sizewell B, in Suffolk, on Tuesday. The Guardian also highlights a report for Friends of the Earth written by Paul Brown, one of the paper's former staffers. The report claims that nuclear plants could be forced to shut down because the reprocessing facility at Sellafield, in Cumbria, is running out of space. It concludes that nuclear power is too dangerous and costly, saying: \"The economics of new nuclear power stations for the UK do not add up. \"It is not possible to achieve what the government says it will do - build a new generation of nuclear power stations in England without public subsidy.\" The Times glosses over such warnings, conceding that \"new calculations about the cost of decommissioning nuclear electricity plants have added to policymakers' headaches\". But it still has faith in the market to deliver ... up to a point, saying: \"Market forces will provide most of the answers if its agents are confident that the government, and future ones, are committed supporters.\" Blogger Jon Worth questions the timing of Brown's announcement. Greenpeace agrees, saying: \"The nuclear industry has had a woeful 24 hours that must be shaking confidence in this outdated technology. Unless Brown is about to appoint an alchemist to the cabinet, nuclear power will do nothing to address any concerns over oil.\" Blogger nobollockpolitics says Brown's enthusiasm for nuclear power is too late. \"We'll be lucky to see any new reactors this side of 2020,\" he reckons. \"At least a decade of energy impoverishment beckons.\" This is an extended extract of the Wrap, guardian.co.uk's digest of the days papers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/feb/12/british-energy-edf-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-12T13:15:49Z","webTitle":"British Energy earnings boost EDF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/12/british-energy-edf-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/feb/12/british-energy-edf-profits","fields":{"headline":"Power of British Energy boosts EDF","bodyText":"State-owned EDF, the new owner of British Energy, the UK's main nuclear power operator, today reported a 23% rise in pre-tax earnings by its British subsidiary last year because of higher consumer bills. But EDF Energy was also forced to write down several commodities hedging contracts, reducing its earnings to €944m (£852m) on sales up 13.3% at €8.2bn. The French group, which today called a halt to its aggressive acquisitions strategy, reported an overall operating income of €7.9bn, down from €10bn in 2007, and net earnings of €3.4bn, down from €5.6bn. The main cause was changes in French regulated prices. The group said EDF Energy's pre-tax profits were hit by the euro's rise against the pound, knocking off €185m. But it said the £12.2bn acquisition of British Energy would boost earnings and reinforce the balance between its upstream and downstream businesses. Pierre Gadonneix, EDF's chairman and chief executive officer, said: \"2008 will go down as a milestone year in EDF's industrial development, with two structuring external growth transactions that lay the foundations for our future growth: the acquisition of British Energy and the agreement to acquire close to 50% of Constellation nuclear assets, our electrician partner in the United States. \"The recent announcement that a second EPR [new-generation nuclear reactor] is to be constructed in France also illustrates this new industrial age marked by the development of CO2-free energy and the revival of nuclear power. \"In 2008, in a worsened economic environment, we upheld our results and demonstrated the robustness of our industrial model. In 2009, we will be giving priority to organic growth through investment, particularly in France, the improvement of our operating performance, the integration of recently acquired companies and the reinforcement of our financial structure.

The treaty is the bedrock of attempts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, but is fraying at the edges. All five permanent members of the UN security council – the US, Russia, China, France and Britain – are nuclear powers, and are recognised as such in the NPT. The idea at the heart of the treaty is that the five are to progressively disarm in return for other states not acquiring the bomb. The treaty's supporters say it has been relatively successful, noting that many more countries would have been likely to procure the bomb over the past four decades had it not been for the agreement. But the big nuclear powers have failed to keep their side of the bargain, effectively encouraging other states to go nuclear. India, Pakistan and Israel have nuclear weapons, and are three of the four countries not to have signed the NPT. North Korea is the other and, along with Iran, it is suspected of developing nuclear weapons. Apartheid South Africa built a bomb but, uniquely, voluntarily relinquished its nuclear capacity in the 1990s. Saddam Hussein's Iraq tried and failed to develop nuclear weapons. Libya was caught buying bombmaking equipment and gave up. Japan has the fissile material and knowhow to develop one quickly, and building a bomb would not be difficult for Germany either. Experts believe that about 25 countries have sought to obtain nuclear weapons. Other nations occasionally rumoured to have nuclear ambitions include Brazil, Argentina, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. The black market run by the Pakistani metallurgist Abdul Qadeer Khan – the world's biggest nuclear racket, which was uncovered in 2003 – helped Iran, Libya and North Korea. It fuelled fears of a \"non-state actor\" or terrorist organisation being able to acquire a nuclear device. Israel has never officially declared itself to be a nuclear state, but is by some distance the mightiest nuclear power outside the big five. It had a rudimentary device by the late 1960s and is estimated to have stockpiles of more than half a tonne of plutonium and an unknown quantity of weapons-grade high-enriched uranium. The plutonium stockpile is more than the combined total held by the other non-big five nuclear powers and experts estimate that it has around 200 nuclear devices. India went public with its nuclear testing in the Rajasthan desert in 1974, and is now thought to have around 70 nuclear devices. The Indian feat triggered Pakistan's race for the bomb, with Khan playing a central role before turning to the black market. Islamabad announced that it was a nuclear power in 1998, and is believed to have around 15 nuclear devices. The NPT came into force in 1970 and, of the known nuclear bomb states, Pakistan is the only one confirmed to have built a bomb after the NPT regime was in place. North Korea has bragged that it could test a nuclear bomb whenever it wanted to, and Washington suspects that Pyongyang has two devices. Iran's clandestine nuclear projects, more than 20 years old, were discovered in 2003, creating the ongoing crisis. Tehran refuses to halt its uranium enrichment operations, based at underground fortified complex at Natanz.

And yet we have other expenses in mind today, for there is disquiet about what is happening in these cash-straitened times to bills passed with considerable fanfare through ours, the mother of parliaments. Asked why sections of the Warm Homes Act seem to have been left unloved and unimplemented, ministers said: we haven't got the funding. But implementation expenses were made available by statute within the act itself, said the likes of Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth. Oh that, said Joan Ruddock, the climate change minister - \"Provisions like that section are commonly included in bills, and therefore in acts of parliament, without any intention that they should have a substantive legal effect,\" she explained when challenged by Dai Davies MP. So the money is there, but in fact it isn't. Ministers have to implement the law, but in fact they don't. They listen when they want and hear what they like. All in all, nice work. Yes, times are hard but if we just stay calm we will get through this. Forget there is a recession. Make like nothing's happened. That's what Tories are doing in London, where for £25 those who have it can join Ed Vaizey, the shadow arts minister (left), on Thursday to discuss these stressful times at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Mayfair over champagne, bellinis and canapes. Some will carp, but it is only £25 a ticket and Ed is worth it. Could have been £26. In good times might have been £30. \"Nuclear power? Yes please ...\" says the Independent, reporting on the decision of four \"leading greens\" to back nuclear power. \"They have now changed their minds over atomic energy,\" the story said. It's a \"volte face\", a \"U-turn\". One of them, Stephen Tindale, is a former director of Greenpeace who was, according to the report, \"vehemently anti-nuclear\" but has changed his mind: not a sudden change, more a realisation \"over the past four years\". Does this coincide with the period in which he worked as head of communications for the renewables arm of RWE, a German firm which has stakes in 20 nuclear power plants? It doesn't say. Perhaps it should. ID fraud is everywhere, the authorities tell us. Everyone is a potential victim. The damage can be incalculable. Consider the plight of Margaret Ann Fisken, London-based chair of the Catholic Association for Racial Justice (and daughter of Sir Ellis Clark, former president of Trinidad and Tobago) who was recently the victim of an email scam on Hotmail. A message was sent saying she was stranded in Africa, with no money, documents all lost, and requiring $3,800 from a kindly soul to get her home. \"Please i (sic) want you to help me with some of money to pay the hotel bill that i am owning the management the bills is $1,800 also with an extra sum of $2,000 to accommodate myself back home, kindly help me out from this mess, i will pay you back when am back to the state,\" it said. This is irritating on so many levels that we barely know where to start. What price reputation? \"How could so many people believe that such a piece of writing came from me,\" asks the Washington- educated lawyer. Oh, the indignity. Finally, was there any possibility that John Prescott would fail to respond to Chris Mullin's revelation that the former deputy prime minister once turned up for work wearing two odd shoes? No, we didn't think so either. \"It did happen,\" Prezza confessed on Twitter yesterday, but he wasn't the only minister sartorially challenged. Once, blogged Prezza, he was summoned as ministerial security tried to deal with a tramp \"in a thick overcoat, scarf, gloves and a woolly Russian cap\" that covered his face and ears. \"That's no tramp, that's my junior minister, Chris Mullin,\" said kindhearted Prezza. A kindheart no more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/mar/06/green-politics-ed-miliband-low-carbon","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-06T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"New green strategy could create 400,000 jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/06/green-politics-ed-miliband-low-carbon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/mar/06/green-politics-ed-miliband-low-carbon","fields":{"headline":"New green strategy could create 400,000 jobs","bodyText":"New jobs will be created in low-carbon industries for 400,000 people - from lagging lofts to nuclear power - the government will announce today. In an interview with the Guardian, Ed Miliband, the climate change secretary, said there was a global race towards creating a low-carbon economy and that Britain must not get left behind. He set out the key elements required - from energy efficiency to a smart electricity grid - ahead of today's low-carbon summit in London, with representatives from industry, unions and the environment movement. Gordon Brown will launch the summit, which will examine how the UK can boost jobs and investment in areas such as cleaner vehicles and low-carbon energy. Brown will also call for a \"global green new deal\" in which government spending tackles economic and climate problems simultaneously. The summit will be hosted by Miliband and business secretary Lord Mandelson, who will publish their vision of a low-carbon industrial strategy. The strategy, seen by the Guardian, says: \"The transition will transform our whole economy. It will change our industrial landscape ... and the way in which we all work and consume.\" Miliband said the most important first step was encouraging business to achieve greater energy efficiency, especially for buildings, which is seen as the quickest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could save companies £3.3bn a year. Britain must also make longer-term investments in a \"smart electricity grid\", using digital technology to improve management of demand and so reduce the overall need for generating capacity. As well as renewable energy, Miliband said nuclear and coal-fired power plants were central to the strategy. \"We need to move towards a trinity of low-carbon fuels,\" he said. \"Coal will remain part of the energy mix in this country certainly for some years to come but it needs to be clean coal.\" A government announcement on funding for carbon capture and storage technology, which would bury emissions, has been delayed by a dispute with the Treasury over costs. The other key areas are cleaner vehicles, funding for research and development, and skills training. Responses from the summit and a consultation will be fed into a final strategy, due this summer, which officials said would include new initiatives beyond existing government policies, such as the pledge this year to give every home a green makeover by 2030. There will also be discussions about how to create as many jobs as possible in the UK, using policies such as regional aid and the £175bn a year spent by the public sector. The government will also publish a report commissioned from consultants Innovas, which forecasts the creation of an additional 400,000 jobs by UK environmental industries in the next eight years. James Cameron, vice-chairman of consultants Climate Change Capital and an executive deemed to have the ear of ministers, has suggested the government establishes \"carbon bonds\" similar to war bonds issued in the second world war. \"I believe that now is the time for the government to consider, with urgency, the issue of bonds for ... reducing greenhouse gases ... while at the same time kick-starting the faltering economy,\" he said. The Renewable Energy Association supports a bond strategy, which it believes could raise £2bn. It has also called for the government to spend £520m immediately. Friends of the Earth said measures to tackle climate change must be at the heart of next month's budget, with the government investing at least an extra £20bn annually over the next 10 years. How to cut UK CO2 emissions Energy efficiency More than half of UK emissions are generated to heat and power buildings. Climate change economics guru Lord Stern calculated that the four best green investments based on cost and benefits were all variations on efficiency improvements for homes, other buildings and their appliances. The government has already pledged a green makeover for every home. Low carbon energy Buildings - and the rest of the economy - need \"clean\" energy. Ministers identify three key areas: renewable technologies, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage for coal generators. Smart grid Energy experts this week called for £4.7bn to upgrade the National Grid to cope with new wind farms and nuclear power. Minsters want to build a digital \"smart grid\", including a smart meter in every home by 2020, to monitor demand more finely and so reduce the need for generating capacity. Clean vehicles Another quarter of emissions are from road transport. After efficiency, Stern rates more fuel-efficient cars as the next best green investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/nov/16/italy-cant-ditch-silvio-berlusconi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-16T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"How can Silvio Berlusconi still be in power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/16/italy-cant-ditch-silvio-berlusconi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/nov/16/italy-cant-ditch-silvio-berlusconi","fields":{"headline":"How can Silvio Berlusconi still be in power?","bodyText":"It's getting hard to know what else Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, has to do to get evicted from power. In most countries, just one of the dozens of scandals he has been involved in would be enough to finish him off politically. Each time a new scandal explodes, more sordid and incredible than the last, you think he can't possibly ride this one out. He can't possibly, you hopefully imagine, survive a court verdict that says he was bribing a lawyer to give false testimony or just shrug off the mountain of evidence that he regularly organises orgies with paid escorts at his private, and official, residences. And yet, there he is, still in power, still the leader of one of Europe's most cultured and important countries. After all these years, it still beggars belief. I'm sure you've heard it all before, but it's worth remembering how many scandals he has so far survived. There have been the endless court cases for corruption which have led to a confusing series of convictions and absolutions. For anyone who has followed the story of the acquisition of the Mondadori publishing giant, or the David Mills case, there's more than enough smoke to suspect one hell of a lot of fire. Berlusconi was found guilty of perjury when he denied that he was a member of a sinister, far-right masonic lodge, P2, that was dissatisfied with the drift of democratic politics. There have been repeated whispers about an incredible proximity to the mafia: back in the 1970s he employed as a stable hand a man called Vittorio Mangano, a mafioso convicted for murder, drug trafficking and extortion. Berlusconi has never explained what he, a Milanese businessman, was doing employing such a gentleman. Nor has he ever adequately answered one of the greatest mysteries in his astonishing career: who put up the huge sums of capital to fund the construction of his housing estates in the Milanese suburbs almost 40 years ago? There has long been suspicion that he was being funded through a bank, the Banca Rasini, where his father worked and where various Sicilian godfathers put their \"savings\". Indeed, one of his closest allies, Marcello Dell'Utri, was recently sentenced to seven years for collusion with the mafia. Various super-grasses have emerged in recent years to say that Cosa Nostra saw Forza Italia, Berlusconi's political party, as the right Trojan horse with which to enter power. The fact that Berlusconi won 100% of the directly elected seats in Sicily in 2001 says everything about which horse Cosa Nostra has decided to crawl inside. And then, of course, there are the prostitutes. The Italians are far less puritan than us about such things, and sex scandals as such are rare. Berlusconi's active sex life has become a political issue not because he's getting laid a lot but because he's said to have told so many lies about what's going on that he makes Walter Mitty appear like a slave to the truth. When he was photographed at Noemi Letizia's 18th birthday people began to ask how on earth a teenager got to hang out with the prime minister and why she called him \"Daddy\". Berlusconi's reply was that her real dad was an old friend because he used to be the chauffeur of Bettino Craxi, Berlusconi's political protector in the 1980s and a man who fled to exile in Tunisia to avoid corruption charges. The chauffeur story, of course, was complete bull. So how did he know her? No one knows. He seems to have been offering businessmen such as Giampaolo Tarantini from Bari breakthroughs in their business deals in return for a supply of women. He is said to have been interfering with justice by springing a 17-year-old Moroccan call-girl named Karima El-Mahroug – stage name Ruby Rubacuore, or \"Ruby Heart-robber\" – from jail by saying she was Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak's granddaughter. Ruby has described orgiastic sex games called Bunga Bunga, a word which will never now leave the Italian lexicon. Berlusconi's soon-to-be ex-wife has said he frequents minors and needs help. The divorce between Veronica Lario and Berlusconi is due to be finalised soon, further removing him from the sound advice or wise oversight of a spouse. In the words of one of the opposition leaders, \"the problem now isn't judicial or political, it's psychiatric.\" But even all those stories paled into insignificance last week as new allegations emerged about teenage girls smoking dope in Sardinia that had been flown in on Berlusconi's private jet. One of those interviewed by magistrates has claimed that he gave her 10,000 euros in an envelope after a sexual encounter and that he also phoned her mother to ask what he could do for her. Nice touch. Until recently the sex stories have seemed barely to dent Berlusconi's reputation. Many Italians envy or admire his success with women – if that's what it is if you pay 10 grand a time. Many of the electorate seem to like the fact that their leader is reliably red-blooded and doesn't lie about it. It's telling that it was one of his own magazines that splashed the first \"Berlusconi and his harem\" story three years ago: they seemed to know that having teenage girls on his lap would only help his poll ratings. But even that blase attitude seems to have changed. It has changed partly because it seems likely that he is repeatedly compromising security; and partly because his eye for women appears to determine who gets a job, who gets a contract, even who gets into politics (like the former show-girl Nicole Minetti). And, relaxed as the Italian electorate is regarding sex, they know hypocrisy when they smell it. Last week, just as the latest revelations were emerging, Berlusconi's government announced that street prostitution would be made illegal. It was a bit like an alcoholic headmaster telling his schoolchildren that they couldn't drink Coke. But most of all, attitudes have changed because Italians admire style and charm and panache, especially when it comes to seduction, and Berlusconi has repeatedly come across as nothing more than a feudal groper and a doddery old bigot. Visiting Aquila after the earthquake 18 months ago he turned to a city councillor and said: \"Can I fondle you?\" He gives the impression he really does believe in droit de seigneur, the medieval ritual that the overlord should have first pickings of his kingdom's virgins. He said as much to one of his female parliamentarians. Berlusconi's defence for his weakness for female flesh (\"better a passion for beautiful girls than being gay\") was also seen as simply stupid, a crass, offensive comment that would in itself have created a scandal in any normal country. But as much as everything Berlusconi has done, the crisis has also come to a head for what he hasn't done. The residents of Aquila are still living among the ruins of their houses 18 months after the terrible earthquake. For all his promises, Berlusconi's government has been almost completely absent. (It's telling that on the day of the earthquake constructors were recorded by magistrates chuckling at the amount of money they could make out of the tragedy; and that the head of the Civil Protection, the man responsible for the reconstruction, is said to have received late-night \"goings over\" from a Brazilian masseuse laid on by those same constructors.) Just this week, a central part of Pompeii fell to the ground, another victim of government neglect and incompetence. It seems that parts of Italy are literally in ruins while the only thing the great leader cares about is getting his end away. He has turned his country into a complete joke: even British comedy shows such as Harry and Paul or Bremner, Bird and Fortune have regular slots spoofing him. There are so many smoking guns surrounding the man that it often looks like a war-zone. How on earth is he still in power and how on earth will the Italians ever get rid of him? The most obvious reply, and still the most convincing, is the simple fact that he and his family own vast swaths of the Italian media: three national TV channels, a huge publishing firm, a major newspaper and dozens of magazines. The true parliament, the real focus of national debate, is the TV chat show and Berlusconi, of course, owns most of the studios. That concentration of media power in his hands means that any political fight appears like a contest between a nuclear power and a kid with a dagger. Whenever anyone dares criticise Berlusconi the dogs of war are unleashed and a smear campaign is mounted. Gianfranco Fini, long thought of as Berlusconi's dauphin, was the chosen victim this summer. As Fini tried to distance himself from the political car crash of Berlusconi's government, he was accused of financial impropriety in his property dealings in Monaco. Emma Marcegaglia, the young head of Confindustria (Italy's equivalent of the CBI) and vocal critic of Berlusconi, has faced similar smears. I've been a victim myself. Years ago, when I published a book that was teeth-grittingly angry about everything Berlusconi was doing to Italy, a long article appeared in one of his magazines denouncing me as the \"English Pinocchio\"; his scary minister of communications accused my writing of being a mixture of \"marxism and bigotry\". For as long as Berlusconi holds such media power, no one really dares to wield the knife. To do so would be, paradoxically, not political ambition but political suicide. It's telling that the most credible threats to him come from his own camp, because the centre-left opposition is notoriously divided and weak. In the 12 years that I've been reporting on Italian politics the centre-left has changed leader and portfolios so many times that it feels like they're just frantically playing musical chairs. The leaders in that time have been – off the top of my head – Prodi, D'Alema, Amato, Rutelli, Fassino, Prodi again, Veltroni and now Bersani. And while many people loathe Berlusconi, many more, I'm afraid, find the centre-left parties fairly pathetic. The Northern League has been incredibly successful at mopping up the working-class vote in huge swaths of the north that used to be part of the reliable, leftwing rump. And it has become very clear that, if no one will ever wield the knife politically, nor will Berlusconi ever fall on his sword. For all his faults, he's a fighter, a dogged, determined, never-say-die sort. When he spent five years in opposition between 1996 and 2001 he spoke of it in biblical terms as his \"time in the desert\". But such is his messiah complex that he never doubted he would enjoy a political resurrection. The only time I've ever had a grudging admiration for him was when, recently, a miniature statue of Milan cathedral was thrown at him, breaking his teeth and causing much blood. As his security men tried to bundle him away, he stood up on the car and shouted defiantly at his assailant. Here was a man in his 70s who had been pretty severely bloodied, who might rightly have assumed that his life was under threat, and he had the courage to face down his attacker. He is the same in politics. Any attack will immediately be met with counter-attack. He will never, ever give up. In most countries, the usual mechanism to remove that sort of leader is by appealing to the national interest. In that way a politician's exit can give them some dignity, and they can relish the sense that they are making a great sacrifice in the interests of their beloved country. But although Berlusconi really does believe he is some sort of saviour, he's not the sort of saviour who believes in self-sacrifice. And nor, moreover, does he believe in the national interest. Barely anything that has happened under his government suggests he has any notion of the interests of Italy. He has spent almost two decades subjugating the country's interests to his own: trying to ruin RAI, the national state broadcaster and rival to his own media empire, Mediaset; decriminalising false accounting; decreasing the statute of limitations so that crimes pass their sentence-by date incredibly quickly. Every political decision, it seems, serves Silvio, not the peninsula as a whole. The tragic genius of Berlusconi is that he appears to have convinced millions that his destiny is their destiny: everyone who is scared of becoming a victim of judicial persecution, who feels overtaxed, who fears that foreigners are condescendingly critical of the Italian way of life is subtly persuaded that getting rid of Silvio would leave them vulnerable and isolated. And yet many of his fanatical admirers now admit that the man is a liability. Every time he steps on to the world stage Italians hold their breath and wait for him to humiliate himself and their country: in recent years he has called Obama \"tanned\", he has been told to pipe down by the Queen, he has kept Nato leaders waiting while he turned his back on them and yakked on his mobile phone and he has made a pistol gesture at an awkward journalist. And yet the country seems unable to throw him off: Fini seems to lack the cojones to vote against him in a confidence motion and the opposition can't do it by themselves. Part of the problem is that anyone seen as responsible for forcing elections, and risking parliamentary approval of the 2011 budget at a time of profound economic crisis, will be punished at the ballot box. Parliament is paralysed. The government lost three votes in one day last week. Yesterday, a week after demanding Berlusconi's resignation, Fini's Future and Liberty party formally left the coalition. But the government is still there, like a battered boxer who has no trainer to throw in the towel. The size of the problem was illustrated to me recently in conversation with a gentle lawyer from Rome. Conversation had turned, as it does with monotonous regularity, to Berlusconi, and the lawyer confided that he felt assassination was the only way the country would ever liberate itself of the man. He's normally such a pacifist that I assumed he was joking, but he was serious. He couldn't see any other way in which the country could get rid of its prime minister. Now I dislike Berlusconi as much as anyone, but I would far rather have him in power than have a return to the bloodshed of the \"years of lead\" in the 1970s. And yet when a law-abiding, middle-class, Catholic lawyer starts talking quite seriously about armed insurrection you know something is terribly wrong in the country, that it has reached a very dangerous political cul-de-sac. And so the country finds itself in a stalemate, unable to continue with Berlusconi but unable to replace him. Ever since he came to power in 1994 he has been, in the words of the late Indro Montanelli, \"the boulder that paralyses Italian politics\". There is no political discussion without mention of the man. Everything revolves around him. You never go out to dinner without his name coming up. Every election since 1994 has basically been a referendum on him, with the current score – he likes his football analogies – 3-2 in his favour. Getting rid of him isn't simply a question of an election or a political coup. He has lost before and has bounced back. The only way to liberate Italian politics from his immense and deleterious influence would be either for him to pass away, or for the country to undergo a thorough, programmatic deBerlusconification, an attempt to return to reality after 20 years of his televisual brainwashing. The first, I'm afraid, is more likely than the second, but it still seems a very long way off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2009/jul/06/tony-blair-climate-copenhagen","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-06T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"L'Aquila summit needs to capitalise on global goodwill on climate change | Tony Blair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/jul/06/tony-blair-climate-copenhagen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2009/jul/06/tony-blair-climate-copenhagen","fields":{"headline":"L'Aquila summit needs to capitalise on global goodwill on climate change","bodyText":"On July 9, the leaders of the world's largest economies will meet in L'Aquila, Italy, at the Major Economies Forum (MEF) on Energy and Climate to discuss progress towards a new global climate agreement. In six months, a deal is supposed to be struck in Copenhagen, so the MEF meeting comes at a vital moment. When many of the same leaders met in April to address the economic crisis, they rightly pledged to do \"whatever is necessary.\" The same spirit needs to animate the L'Aquila meeting. There is enormous goodwill to do so. The new US administration is supporting strong American action. China is setting ambitious targets for reducing energy intensity and making massive investments in renewable energy. India has put forward its own action plan. Europe has set a goal of cutting emissions by 30% below 1990 levels by 2020 if there is an ambitious global agreement. Japan has published its proposals for major carbon reductions. Across the world, commitments are forthcoming. But practical challenges remain. What is being asked is that global emissions be less than half their 1990 levels by 2050, having peaked before 2020. Since emissions from the developing countries are on the whole lower than those of the developed world — and will need to continue to rise in the short-term as they maintain economic growth and address poverty — it has been proposed that developed countries cut emissions by at least 80% relative to 1990 by 2050, with major steps towards this goal over the next decade. Developing countries will also need to play their part, significantly slowing and peaking emissions growth in the coming decades. For the US, such commitments would mean cutting emissions to around one-tenth of today's per capita level, while for China it would mean creating a new low-carbon model of economic development. For all countries, this is a major challenge — a revolution that implies a huge shift in policy. The good news is that if we focus on clear, practical, and achievable goals, major reductions can be made in order to ensure that, whatever the precise interim target, the world will fashion a radical new approach within a manageable timeframe. A new report from the Breaking the Climate Deadlock project, a strategic partnership between my office and The Climate Group, shows how major reductions even by 2020 are achievable if we focus action on certain key technologies, deploy policies that have been proven to work, and invest now in developing those future technologies that will take time to mature. Perhaps the most interesting fact to emerge is that fully 70% of the reductions needed by 2020 can be achieved by investing in three areas: increasing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, and use of lower-carbon energy sources, including nuclear and renewables. Implementing just seven proven policies – renewable energy standards (eg, feed-in tariffs or renewable portfolio standards); industry efficiency measures; building codes; vehicle efficiency standards; fuel carbon content standards; appliance standards, and policies for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Redd) — can deliver these reductions. All seven policies have already been successfully implemented in countries around the world, but they need scaling up. While cap-and-trade systems or other means of pricing carbon emissions can help provide incentives for businesses to invest in low-carbon solutions, in the short term at least, these seven policy measures — and direct action and investment by governments — are needed to achieve the targets. In the longer term, we also need technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), expanded nuclear power, and new generations of solar energy, together with the development of technologies whose potential or even existence is still unknown. The important thing for Copenhagen is that decisions are taken now for investments that will yield benefits later. For example, the overwhelming majority of new power stations in China and India — necessary to drive the industrialisation that will lift hundreds of millions out of poverty — will be coal-fired. That is just a fact. So developing CCS or an alternative that allows coal to become clean energy is essential for meeting the 2050 goal. But we need to invest now, seriously and through global collaboration, so that by 2020 we are in a position to scale up CCS or be ready to deploy other alternatives. Renaissance of nuclear power will require a big expansion of qualified scientists and engineers. Electric vehicles will need large adjustments to infrastructure. Smart grid systems can enable big savings in emissions, but require a plan for putting them into effect. These measures will take time, but require investment now. Meanwhile, in the short term, low energy lighting and efficient industrial motors may sound obvious, but we are nowhere near using them as extensively as we could. So we know what we need to do, and we have tools available to achieve our goals. MEF leaders can therefore have confidence in adopting the interim and long-term targets recommended by the scientific community: keeping warming to below 2C; peaking emissions within the next decade; and at least halving global emissions by 2050 versus 1990. Developed countries will be able to commit to reducing their emissions by 80% versus 1990 by mid-century, as many have already done, and provide the necessary financial and technology support for developing countries' adaptation and mitigation efforts. With that support, developing countries in turn will need to design and implement Low-Carbon Growth Plans that significantly slow and eventually peak their emissions growth. By making these commitments, the MEF leaders, whose countries account for more than three-quarters of global emissions, would lay a firm foundation for success in Copenhagen. Between L'Aquila and Copenhagen, there will undoubtedly be difficult discussions over interim targets for developed countries. While such targets are important, what matters most is agreement on the measures that ultimately will set the world on a new path to a low-carbon future. For years, the emphasis has rightly been on persuading people that there must be sufficient \"will\" to tackle climate change. But leaders, struggling to cope with this challenge even amid economic crisis, need to know that there is also \"a way.\" Only by combining the two will we succeed. Fortunately, such a way — immensely challenging but nonetheless feasible — exists.

Tony Blair achieved popularity by pursuing unpopularity for its own sake. Now, having prevaricated and procrastinated, Gordon Brown too is trying to portray himself as a decisive and strong leader with the same strategy: take unpopular decisions, not because they're right, but precisely because they're unpopular. How many times have we heard the prime minister talking about \"tough decisions\"? Nuclear power is the latest manifestation of New Labour unpopulism. This technology is attractive precisely because it's unattractive. In the face of climate change, concerns about energy security and rising fuel bills, people want to feel noble and self-sacrificing with a bold leader willing to take those \"tough decisions\". Or so goes Brown's thinking. We, the public, are in a conflicted state. We now accept that we need to make sacrifices and accept unpalatable changes to our lives. Nuclear power strikes a chord and seems like the perfect answer. Sure it's unpalatable, and yes nuclear power leaves a legacy of radioactive waste, and yes it's really expensive, and yes it's dangerous - but that's exactly why it seems like the sort of sacrifice we should be making. Clearly, nobody would take this decision unless extreme circumstances demanded such extreme measures - indeed, unless it was in the \"best interests of the country\". Brown's problem is that he's not so much spinning as reeling. What's the payoff for enduring the risk, delay and cost of a new nuclear programme? Low emissions? The government's own figures say that 10 new nuclear reactors in Britain would only cut our carbon emissions by 4% sometime after 2020. Several other energy sources are far less carbon intensive and deliver more energy: Germany's renewables sector provides more energy than the UK's nuclear power stations and a major report from the Department for Business, Energy and Regulatory Reform said microgeneration could produce the same amount of energy as five nuclear plants. Rising oil prices? But oil is used overwhelmingly for transport which nuclear power does nothing about. Intermittency - if we don't build nuclear the lights will go out? Well, last week 10 of our 16 nuclear reactors did shut down - and the lights did go out. So what is nuclear's unique selling point? Erm ... Huge atomic infrastructure projects represent the ultimate tough decision. Any prime minister who can strong-arm the British public into spending literally hundreds of billions of pounds on this white elephant is certainly bold, strong and showing extraordinary leadership. And that's what this is all about - presentation dictating policy. Why else would nuclear power, detention without trial and tax rises for the poor overtake social justice as the Labour vision? With his empire crumbling, the clunking fist wants a show of strength to demonstrate that he's in charge, and nothing shows you're in charge like nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/nov/01/climatechange-catastrophes-democracy-end","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-01T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"The climate of fear | Peter Preston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/01/climatechange-catastrophes-democracy-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/01/climatechange-catastrophes-democracy-end","fields":{"headline":"The climate of fear","bodyText":"Sometimes, when you file a column like this, you begin with a gentle request to the subeditor. For instance: \"Please don't choose a headline saying 'Today's Greens are tomorrow's fascists'. That's not what I'm saying. The end of democracy, and maybe the end of the world, will be a lot more complicated than that.\" And, of course, complications come deep-fried, boiled or roasted when you start stirring the global warming pot. If Nick Griffin had got an environmental word in edgeways on Question Time, he'd have talked BNP policy on offshore wind farms, high-speed rail links, fast-breeder nuclear power stations and a Boris island in the Thames estuary, as well as clearing the immigrant decks: he would also, in a manifesto mutter, have acknowledged that \"some climate change may be manmade\". Even the far right knows there's a problem. The question – looming, receding, drifting back and forth between Kyoto and Copenhagen – is whether anyone has the will to do anything about it. Consider the EU summit last week which didn't offer Tony Blair a new, rather boring chairman's job. It didn't offer much on saving the planet, either. By 2020, apparently, poor countries will need £90bn or so to help them grow in the best green ways, and Europe will have to stump up some of that: but the first, much smaller bill for £6bn-plus drops in January, and nobody wants to sign for that. Poland won't pay, others from the east say they can't find the cash. Germany will only go so far. So the summit's 27 statesmen stand back and wait for Barack Obama. And, as usual, nothing gets done. Democrats can talk the talk when sacrifices come later. By 2020, none of them will still be in power. But 2010, and another bout of electoral retribution from voters already cheesed off because their Oz holidays suddenly got more expensive? Nobody wants to walk that walk as far as the nearest departure gate. The perceived name of the game is sounding sombre and promising to rescue the earth: but not until the last ballot box is opened. Naturally you can grow too cynical. I don't suppose Ed Miliband thinks he's just going through the motions. I'm sure Obama believes that, yes, he can do something useful. The ritual post-summit briefings where world leaders hail progress and green activists cry too little, too late, have a malign habit of fuelling despair. But it is, indeed, desperately late already to begin wondering openly whether democracy, in its rhetorical aspirations and covert calculations, in its consensual stumblings and murmured frailties, can cope with the upheaval that science tells us is necessary. After all, if our former postie of a home secretary can't abide scientists getting more stressed over gin and tonic than a reefer, why should he jump to attention when professors everywhere advocate far more radical – and expensive – change? The BNP, for what little it's worth, feeds on despair. It takes the multicultural world we live in and promises to make it white and simple again. Forget Europe, forget treaties, obligations, UN charters. The fear is father of the deed. And this is the soil in which autocracies flourish. This is what happens politically when the options run out. We're used to the awful prophesies of cities submerged, continents parched, millions left to perish. But we're not used to thinking through what these things will mean for the systems we live by, the norms we embrace. Take the sum of all fears, when it's (almost) too late. Take the realisation, at last, that something has to be done. Take the sudden, alarmed perception that bickering politicians have been the problem all these years, not the solution. Then take the greatest care. See what a relatively few terrorist strikes have wrought by way of corners cut, liberties eroded. Imagine how a savage mix of floods and droughts will devastate old assumptions. Enter a strong man, or a series of strong men, promising extraordinary action. Exit a generation of failed leaders without, it is said, the strength to lead. If our climate changes, then much else must change with it. If Copenhagen sets a time scale for action, then every second counts. If public fear cries at last for sacrifice rather than temporising, then there will be no time for those we chose to lead us in an environment where debate and delay never ceases. That's democracy, of course. Our way, our belief. But, put to the test on current performance, it doesn't sound much like survival – unless the political classes know it's their survival at stake, too.

Breaking out of the \"more of the same\" approach is key to making progress towards abolition. It was disappointing, then, to read David Miliband's comments, pushing attention off on to Iran and North Korea, as usual (New nuclear resolve, 21 September). Perhaps this isn't surprising when you consider that the UK's nuclear policy remains the replacement of Trident – a cold war system with no conceivable military use, and irrelevant to our contemporary security needs. But the population has noticed that the world has changed even if the government hasn't – a significant majority now opposes Trident replacement. Kate Hudson Chair, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament • David Miliband has lots of recommendations for non-nuclear countries and those on the way to nuclearised status, but precious little to say about those already in the club. His argument that the UK has done its bit by reducing our arsenal \"by 75% since the cold war\" is shaky, especially when he adds the doubtful justifications of not having our weapons targeted and being \"on several days' notice to fire\". But the real issue is still not being addressed. We can now say the C-word – \"cuts\". What about The T-word – \"Trident\"? Until our fleet is brought into the equation, all our sermonising about others' nuclear stances is so much untargeted hot air. David Partridge Emsworth, Hampshire • David Miliband supports, as does the UN, a nuclear-free Middle East. So why not tell Iran that if it forgos its rights as a signatory of the existing international non-proliferation treaty in a fully verifiable form, the security council will ensure that Israel becomes a signatory and surrenders its nuclear weapons? Yugo Kovach Winterborne Houghton, Dorset • A new report by the Climate Group claims 1.4% of global economic output, or an annual $1tn, is needed until 2050 to deliver the technology needed to reduce CO2. This is slightly less than the $1.46tn spent globally on the military each year. If we want a secure planet, it's time we rebalanced where we spend our money. President Obama has called on the world to get rid of nuclear weapons. The total cost of Trident until around 2050 is at least £97.5bn (Revealed: the £130bn cost of Trident replacement, 18 September). With one revenue-neutral decision the UK can provide a much-needed boost to both the multilateral disarmament process and the international effort to avert climate catastrophe. John Sauven Executive director, Greenpeace UK • The US military chiefs' argument that cuts in America's nuclear arsenal would spur proliferation is a red herring (Obama faces battle with Pentagon hawks to achieve nuclear-free goal, 21 September). The real reason for their objection is that any reduction in warheads would also result in corresponding cuts in air force and navy delivery systems, and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Obama should tell the secretary of defence that if his generals, admirals and bureaucrats won't provide a realistic number of warheads to maintain the policy of mutually assured destruction, not only will the warheads be culled, but also those who are opposing the reductions. George D Lewis Brackley, Northamptonshire • Should not the prosperous world unite in financing China and India's construction of nuclear power stations to help them extinguish their coal-powered plants? Lend-lease was essential in winning the second world war: does not the enormity of climate war call for the implementation of well-tested methods? It would cost trillions and mean an enormous belt-tightening for everyone. But would the allies have winced at winning at absolutely any cost? Nuclear proliferation would be irrelevant: both China and India are nuclear powers anyway.

Our member companies' experience of supplying their energy efficient solutions to the public sector is that the cheapest, most energy inefficient/polluting option is commonly procured, even where whole-life costs are higher than with more efficient alternatives. In 2006-07, for example, only 8% of all government building projects met the standards for sustainability the government set itself in 2002. Energy efficiency is widely accepted as the by far the most cost-effective means of reducing carbon emissions - and the potential is huge. To date, however, the government has failed to exploit this potential. We need an urgent programme of refurbishment across the government estate to secure the highest standards of energy efficiency. Danny Stevens Deputy director, Environmental Industries Commission Professor Michael Page makes a relevant point in comparing emissions from public buildings with air travel. However neither category is deserving of brownie points. It should not be difficult to reduce emissions from public buildings with almost immediate effect. The appointment of energy managers with clout would be a good start, followed by insulation, cost-effective building modifications and renewable energy. Short of rationing air travel or introducing a personal carbon allowance, I am struggling to see how aviation emissions can be stabilised, let alone reduced. Like the car industry, aviation will marshall the usual suspects of vested interests and lobbyists in its defence. I wouldn't bet on this or any government publicly committing to no further expansion of Heathrow, but if they mean what they have said about the magnitude of CO2 emissions reduction we need to achieve, then cancelling the third runway would be a good start. Bill Hunter Honley, Holmfirth New nuclear power stations are not a diversion from the task of delivering a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, they are part of it. Opposition to nuclear power has probably more to do its historic association with nuclear weapons than the hard mathematics of green solutions for energy. Replacing closing nuclear power stations with new ones on adjacent sites, sharing site management and taking over existing transmission lines provides an economic way of replacing the lost output.

It's not a surprise as it's a corker of a story with all manner of implications. You can read the original story at AlArabiya.net (and the follow-ups at Treehugger and GreenCarReports.com), but here's a quick summary … Sheikh Mohamed Al-Najimi, a scholar at the Saudi Islamic Jurisprudence Academy, reportedly warned students travelling outside Saudi Arabia not to drive any vehicles powered with ethanol because the \"prophet prohibited all kinds of dealings with alcohol including buying, selling, carrying, serving, drinking, and manufacturing\". As ethanol is \"basically made up of alcohol\", it must be avoided. The sheikh was keen to stress that he has not issued a fatwa, but does believe the matter needs further clarification from the relevant Islamic institutions. Now, where do we begin? With the question of what other possible motives there might be for why ethanol might be perceived to be a threat in an oil-rich nation? Or what other environmental innovations (the jury is still out on ethanol, in my view) might come under further scrutiny by religious scholars? For example, Catholicism isn't exactly keen on birth control, which logic suggests might be one of the ways to help reduce population growth. And how might Jewish and Islamic scholars view the use of any fuel made from pig slurry, as has been proposed? (The US anthropologist Marvin Harris once suggested that any religious objections to the rearing and eating of pigs might have been initially formed by concerns about the animal's voracious appetite and, hence, negative impact on the local environment in the region once known as Canaan.) Ignoring for one moment the goings-on in Iran, there also seems to be some debate among Islamic scholars about whether the use of nuclear power is allowed. For example, Indonesia's conservative Sunni Islam group Nahdlatul Ulama decreed in 2007 that the building of the country's first nuclear power plant in central Java would be \"haraam\", or forbidden, under Islam as its potential dangers would outweigh its positives. So, where else might religion and the environment potentially clash? Finally, I hereby decree, with the almighty authority bestowed upon me, that the comments be free of any wisecrack references to environmentalism being \"a fanatical religion\".

The moves by the rubber-stamp National People's Congress are timed to strengthen China's negotiating position as it prepares a new announcement on emissions policy before the UN climate change talks in Copenhagen in December. Environmentalists welcomed the unusually high degree of attention that the NPC's standing committee paid to the environment during a week-long session in which lawmakers also debated a more ambitious target for renewable energy. Details of the final resolution were not immediately available, but a draft submitted this week called on the government to take further measures to control greenhouse gas emissions and invest more in low carbon technology. But there was tough language on international negotiations, noting that China would defend its right to further economic development. Senior lawmakers said further action would follow. \"China will draw up new laws and regulations to provide a legal basis for combating climate change,\" Wang Guangtao, director of the NPC's environment and resource protection committee was quoted as saying by the China Daily. While apparently lacking specific targets to reduce emissions, the resolution was welcomed by environmental groups. \"It's very significant. For the first time, they have put climate change at the core of economic and social planning at all levels of government,\" said Yang Ailun, climate and energy campaign manager for Greenpeace China. \"This lays the ground for China to make a big announcement ahead of Copenhagen.\" Ahead of those crucial climate talks in December, Yang said the government appeared to be leaning towards a mid-term target for carbon intensity, as first reported in the Guardian. This would represent progress from China's current policy of reducing energy use relative to gross domestic product in the latest five-year economic plan. But even the setting of a carbon intensity goal for 2020 would disappoint hopes that China will set a target for overall emissions to peak. Last week, an influential research panel said this might be possible by 2030, but the government has given no suggestion it will make this into policy. The draft resolution called for the government to strengthen its early warning systems and make better preparation for extreme events, such as typhoons. It recommends greater investment in water-saving technologies and low carbon energy. \"We should make carbon reduction a new source of economic growth, and change the economic development model to maximise efficiency, lower energy consumption and minimise carbon discharges,\" the draft says. All of the measures included in the draft resolution were previously outlined in government white papers, but environmentalists said the issue has moved to a more prominent position in the nation's political system and a climate change law is highly likely. \"This is a good step forward,\" said Yang Fuqiang, the director of global climate solutions at the China office of the World Wildlife Fund. \"Before we only had government policy, which local governments could challenge, but a law would be harder to violate.\" Lawmakers are also discussing a revision of the renewable energy law that could set the stage for the government to raise its target for wind, hydro, nuclear, solar and biomass, currently set at 15% of the total energy mix by 2020. China is already ahead of its interim goals for wind, hydro and nuclear power. Each extra percentage point that can be added to the renewables target by 2020 is estimated to save 150 million tonnes of coal equivalent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/jun/22/utilities.oil","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-21T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Tim Webb talks to energy minister Malcolm Wicks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/22/utilities.oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jun/22/utilities.oil","fields":{"headline":"Where does he find the energy?","bodyText":"Try as he might, energy minister Malcolm Wicks cannot escape Greenpeace, avowed enemy of anyone - especially him - who backs nuclear power. In the middle of a train journey to Bristol last Thursday evening, a man wearing a beige fleece and jeans calls down the first-class carriage to the minister. He comes over and hands a bemused Wicks a press release and thick report from the environmental lobby group about renewable energy. 'It will help you come up with a response,' he says helpfully. The bizarre interruption brings some much-needed light relief. Wicks is a worried man. He is worried that Opec, which is holding an emergency summit this weekend in Saudi Arabia, can't pump enough oil. He's worried about soaring fuel prices. He's worried about old people not being able to afford to keep their homes warm in a cold winter. And no wonder. Oil prices have doubled in a year and this month hit $140 a barrel. In the UK, utility bills are heading in the same direction and last month the worst power cuts for a decade plunged parts of the country into darkness. Britain is in the grip of a global energy crisis that seems to get worse by the day. Wicks looks pained. 'I always hesitate a bit to use the word crisis,' he says. 'But if someone used the word I wouldn't necessarily quarrel. This is totally unprecedented. If oil prices double, you are in a totally different ball park. It worries me greatly, not least because of the impact on vulnerable households.' Wicks, a former university lecturer, wrote a book called The Old and the Cold after the oil crisis of the 1970s, when fuel bills soared as now and the elderly struggled to heat their homes. So he knows all about oil shocks. But he's not confident that oil prices will slump again, as they did in the 1980s. 'A Liberal Democrat asked me in the House of Commons to predict what price oil would be in 2020. I said I can't predict what it's going to be next week. If I knew I would probably be a forecaster-stroke-liar and very well paid for that.' Hardly reassuring, but honest. This week, the government will issue what Wicks calls its 'greenprint' to bring about a 'renewable energy revolution'. 'We are talking about a revolution in how we build a house in the future, the kind of cars we drive.' It is fighting talk, but this week's consultation is by all accounts a radical departure from current policy. It has to be. The government has signed up to a binding EU target to source 15 per cent of its energy from renewable, non-fossil fuel sources. That requires a more than 10-fold increase from current levels. Because it is difficult to heat homes or power cars using renewable energy, the heaviest burden for meeting the 15 per cent target will fall on power generators. Analysts estimate that at least a third of all electricity generated will have to come from renewable sources, such as wind or solar energy, to meet the overall target in 2020. Only 5 per cent of the UK's electricity comes from renewables today. That means thousands more wind farms and solar panels and mammoth projects like the Severn barrage, which would be big enough to provide some 5 per cent of the UK's electricity, but cost at least £15bn and take more than a decade to build. Wicks admits that even with all this, the target will not be reached without buying in renewable credits from other countries in Europe. He also admits that the EU targets will add even more to households' utility bills: 'At a time when prices are rising and given the state of technology, the measures we take like the obligation to bring on renewables do add to cost. The EU target will add even more.' The Guardian reported last week that the government's Renewable Advisory Board had concluded that the UK would only be able to source a maximum of 14 per cent of energy from renewables. Wicks is not perturbed: 'It's like a team bragging they're going to win 10-nil and only winning nine-nil. I'm encouraged they are saying 14 per cent is do-able.' Wicks was on his way to the site of the proposed project on the Severn when The Observer interviewed him. He admitted the government was in talks with the European Commission about counting the project's electricity output to help the UK meet its renewable target, even though in 2020 the barrage would still be under construction. He denied this was 'creative accounting', saying it would 'pass the common sense test'. 'Although it's a 2020 target, if the Commission and our colleagues in Europe see the thing is up and building but won't come on stream until 2022... This is a grand project.' Bird lovers, represented by the RSPB, are already up in arms about the barrage, which would involve the construction of a dam, or series of dams, across the estuary, which they say would destroy the habitat for bird and fish. The subject of environmentalists provokes another pained expression from Wicks. 'We have some environmental lobbyists who seem to be opposed to things we need to do,' he sighs. 'Some of these environmentalists who have good hearts but confused minds are almost a barrier to tackling climate change. Historically that will turn out to be sad.' The controversy over the fate of the Severn estuary's mudflats is nothing compared to that over building new nuclear reactors: 'I find it genuinely disappointing and sad that some organisations seem to put their hatred of nuclear above their concern for global warming.' Wicks insists that his support for nuclear power - which results in only low-carbon emissions - does not extend to intervening in the stalled £11bn auction of nuclear generator British Energy. The government owns a 35 per cent stake in the company, whose sites are best to build more reactors. French nuclear giant EDF is the only remaining bidder, but the board of British Energy is demanding that EDF pay more for the company. 'How would we intervene - nationalise British Energy?

The Economics of Nuclear Power, commissioned by Greenpeace concludes that atomic power has been historically linked with high subsidies, complex technology and safety concerns, leaving it a \"dangerous distraction\" to finding better ways of tackling global warming. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at Greenwich University and an author of the report, said: \"The nuclear industry has always made unfulfilled promises; history reveals a damning testament to its failure. Pursuing a new programme of nuclear reactors would deny us the opportunity to make the necessary investment in renewable technologies and energy efficiency to meet future energy needs in a viable and sustainable way.\" A review of nuclear construction in the US shows that 75 reactors were predicted to cost $45bn (£22.5bn) but the actual cost was closer to $145bn. More recently, in India, completion costs for the last ten reactors have been 300% over budget. The report also quotes details from the World Energy Council showing that construction times for the industry were rising from 66 months in the mid-1970s to 116 months - nearly ten years - for completions between 1995 and 2000. A new group of \"generation three\" reactors proposed for Europe and elsewhere are unproven, leading to more potential delays, argues the review, just days before the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change is expected to encourage nations to proceed with new atomic plants. The Guardian revealed yesterday that ministers were planning to fast-track its energy review and give the go ahead to nuclear before Christmas although its earlier plans to press ahead were thrown off course by a legal challenge from Greenpeace which successfully argued there had been insufficient consultation. \"As the government prepares us for the Energy White Paper due later this month, Whitehall sources are behaving irresponsibly and prematurely by backing new nuclear reactors, without conducting the full public consultation that the government is legally obliged to do. Claiming that nuclear is necessary to prevent the lights going out by 2015 is not only alarmist, but untrue and smacks of desperation from a government determined to justify pro-nuclear agenda,\" said Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Nathan Argent last night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/20/nuclear-police-run-covert-network","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-20T18:17:36Z","webTitle":"Secret files reveal covert network run by nuclear police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/20/nuclear-police-run-covert-network","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/20/nuclear-police-run-covert-network","fields":{"headline":"Secret files reveal covert network run by nuclear police","bodyText":"The nuclear industry funds the special armed police force which guards its installations across the UK, and secret documents, seen by the Guardian, show the 750-strong force is authorised to carry out covert intelligence operations against anti-nuclear protesters, one of its main targets. The nuclear industry will pay £57m this year to finance the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC). The funding comes from the companies which run 17 nuclear plants, including Dounreay in Caithness, Sellafield in Cumbria and Dungeness in Kent. Around a third is paid by the private consortium managing Sellafield, which is largely owned by American and French firms. Nearly a fifth of the funding is provided by British Energy, the privatised company owned by French firm EDF. Private correspondence shows that in June, the EDF's head of security complained that the force had overspent its budget \"without timely and satisfactory explanations to us\". The industry acknowledges it is in regular contact with the CNC and the security services. Most of the nuclear force's officers are armed with high-powered guns and Tasers. The CNC has spent £1.4m on weapons and ammunition in the past three years. They patrol outside nuclear plants, with their jurisdiction stretching to three miles beyond the perimeter of the installations. They have the same powers as any other British police officer and can, for instance, arrest and stop and search people. The body that regulates the CNC is also funded by the nuclear industry. Four of the eight members of the Civil Nuclear Police Authority are nominated by the nuclear industry as its representatives. Those four are employed in the industry. The others – mainly former police officers – are deemed to be independent. The force is expected to expand as the government presses ahead with plans for a new generation of nuclear plants, which are likely to attract protests. Ben Ayliffe, head of Greenpeace's anti-nuclear campaign, said: \"There are very obvious worries about an armed police force that is accountable to an industry desperate to build nuclear reactors in the UK. This industry will probably be very keen for their police force to use all the powers available to them to prevent peaceful protests against nuclear power.\" John Sampson, the CNC's deputy chief constable, said the force was by law operationally independent from the industry and safeguarded by its regulatory police authority. Its surveillance operations were only conducted if they had legal approval and were proportionate to the crime under investigation, he added. Sampson said it would be \"ill-advised\" of any nuclear company to put pressure on the force and surveillance was not conducted at the instigation of the companies. The government has provided a small amount of capital funding but does not pay any of the running costs. The job of the force is to protect civil nuclear plants and guard radioactive nuclear material when it is being transported by land, rail or sea to ensure it is not stolen or sabotaged. The industry also receives advice from the security services on how to protect itself from attack. The force is authorised to send informers to infiltrate organisations and to conduct undercover surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). It is also permitted to obtain communications data such as phone numbers and email addresses. Reports by Sir Christopher Rose, the watchdog responsible for inspecting the use of these surveillance powers, have been obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information legislation. Rose, the chief surveillance commissioner, noted last year: \"The strategic aims of the constabulary remain on the threat from terrorism and public disquiet over nuclear matters, including demonstrations/protests and criminal offences towards nuclear movements/installations.\" The force keeps secret the extent of its clandestine surveillance operations on protesters and others. It has been collecting more intelligence in recent years. Sampson said its surveillance was \"relatively modest\" and mainly concerned with stopping terrorism. In July, Rose said the CNC's \"approach to covert activity is conspicuously professional\". He found that the system for storing the intelligence gained from informers was \"working well\". He says he has been told during inspections that \"senior officers regard covert surveillance as a long-term requirement\". Since 2007, the CNC has also been headed by an ex-intelligence official, rather than a police officer. Richard Thompson is reported to have been a senior officer in MI6. Rose noted Thompson \"has extensive experience in the intelligence world, but has no previous police background\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/may/09/britishenergygroupbusiness.europe","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-09T16:59:23Z","webTitle":"EDF sole bidder for British Energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/09/britishenergygroupbusiness.europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/may/09/britishenergygroupbusiness.europe","fields":{"headline":"EDF sole bidder for British Energy","bodyText":"French power group EDF today submitted a firm all-cash offer to buy British Energy, emerging as the sole bidder for the UK's main nuclear power producer. The state-owned group, believed to have offered closer to 600p than the 700p a share originally mooted, is expected to confront rival bids from other European utilities in the coming days or even weeks. Spanish group Iberdrola, owners of Scottish Power, made no offer, according to industry sources who said it had not yet reached a final decision. It was still in talks with Centrica, owners of British Gas, about a potential joint bid. It is understood that Germany's second-largest utility, RWE, mooted throughout today to have withdrawn an indicative 700p a share offer, could re-enter the fray next week while Franco-Belgian group Suez continues to mull an offer. With market sources saying a sole bidder made a mockery of the auction process run by investment bank Rothschild for the government, people close to the bidding process said a firm decision on BE's buyer was unlikely to emerge until June. The government had set today as the deadline for submitting bids for its 35.8% stake in BE but players said this was never meaningful. Rothschild is understood to be continuing discussions with would-be bidders, seeking clarity on their intentions. Banking sources said the bidders' clear aim was to force down BE's share price. It had reached a record 785p in late April but closed at 701p today, valuing the company at just over £11bn. EDF, which refused to comment, is believed to have offered substantially less, with sources close to the bidding process refusing to divulge its offer. The group, which provides the bulk of the nuclear power providing 80% of France's prime energy, could still team up with Centrica at a later stage of the bidding process, other sources said. The UK group, which produces only 40% of its own power needs, is negotiating with the French to take power from BE's existing plants for its industrial and commercial customers on long-term contracts. Both are would-be players in the government's programme to build new-generation nuclear plants alongside BE's existing sites. Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, is understood to remain open to opportunities in the UK market and to be keen to take part in the government's new-build programme. But industry sources indicated that the Spaniards are concerned that any offer it makes for BE must not be dilutive. Industry sources indicated that BE will not command the inflated offers of between 800p and 900p once mooted because of continuing technical problems with its ageing fleet of eight power stations. But interest in the group, which produces 18% of the UK's power needs, has soared because of ministers' plans for a new generation of nuclear plants to help combat global warming and boost security of supply. EDF has emerged as a front-runner to buy the group, which came close to bankruptcy in 2002 and was bailed out by the government, because of its nuclear expertise - and close links with state-owned Areva, the plant manufacturer and designer. It is building a new-generation EPR reactor on the Normandy cost. Areva is one of three overseas groups - with GE-Hitachi and Westinghouse, owned by Japan's Toshiba - to submit new designs for approval by British safety regulators. EDF, meanwhile, has reportedly been buying land around existing nuclear sites in England and Wales - a move seen in its homeland as preparing for a potential defeat in the BE bidding process. It wants to build up four of the possible 10 new nuclear plants sought by the government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cleantechrevolution2009/homemade-power","type":"article","sectionId":"cleantechrevolution2009","sectionName":"The Clean Tech Revolution","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-08T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Homemade power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cleantechrevolution2009/homemade-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cleantechrevolution2009/homemade-power","fields":{"headline":"Homemade power","bodyText":"Ceres Power, a company specialising in domestic fuel cells that convert gas to produce both heat and electricity, was the winner of the Carbon Trust inaugural prize in 2003. The company now has back orders for over 50,000 units, worth about £100m, and is hard at work equipping a new factory in Sussex which will begin production in late 2009. \"Winning the prize reinforced our green credentials with a wide range of stakeholders in the city, the government and the industry,\" says Ceres chief executive Peter Bance. The beauty of the Ceres fuel cell is that it uses nearly all the heat value of the gas it converts, generating electricity to be used at home or exported to the grid, as well as in cental and water heating. Now compare this with the current inefficient way of doing things. Up to three-quarters of the energy of the fuel burnt in power stations is thrown away - flowing out of cooling towers and through transmission losses - before the electricity even reaches our homes. Then we burn even more fuel for hot water and central heating. But put the electricity and heat production together into a Ceres Power unit and you get the same end result, without the waste. Your carbon footprint is halved - along with your electricity bill. Indeed, you could be earning money exporting expensive peak-time units into the grid. There's a real advantage for the individual householder here, with expected fuel cost savings of £250 to £400 per year. But the benefits go much wider than that. The UK is facing an electricity supply gap over the coming decades, and there's still no clear plan for how to fill it. Domestic fuel cells could be the answer. \"About 1.5m domestic boilers are replaced in the UK every year\", says Bance. Replace each one with a 1 kilowatt fuel cell unit, and you are adding 1.5 gigawatts of generation capacity to the UK every year - equivalent to a big coal, gas or nuclear power station. Ten years on, the UK would have an extra 15 gigawatts and the energy gap would be plugged.\" That's not all. \"The UK is facing huge costs to beef up the grid to accommodate wind power, new nuclear stations and so on, \" says Bance. \"By installing generation directly into houses rather than central power stations you reduce both the strain on the grid and the need for capital expenditure. This could save the country billions.\" There's just one problem. Ceres Power's domestic fuel cells are only scheduled to hit the market in 2011, but they are needed now."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk/2009/aug/18/alain-de-botton-heathrow-airport","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-18T20:17:59Z","webTitle":"Heathrow airport hires Alain de Botton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/aug/18/alain-de-botton-heathrow-airport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2009/aug/18/alain-de-botton-heathrow-airport","fields":{"headline":"Heathrow airport hires Alain de Botton","bodyText":"Millions of disgruntled passengers might say it is more suited to high farce than literary endeavour, but Heathrow attained cultural respectability as the author Alain de Botton made his public debut as writer-in-residence at Britain's largest airport. The mind behind tomes such as The Art of Travel and How Proust Can Change Your Life is mastering the more prosaic matters of baggage handling and inflight catering as he becomes the latest artistic figure to tread the precarious line between creative independence and commerce after signing a publishing deal with the financial support of Heathrow's owner, BAA. He follows in the footsteps of others such as bestselling author Fay Weldon, who in one of the most notorious sell-outs of recent times shocked the arts world in 2001 when it emerged that her latest novel had been sponsored by the Italian jewellery firm Bulgari. De Botton says BAA has given him complete editorial freedom and access to all areas as part of a one-book publishing deal. \"One of the first things I said when they offered it to me was that I should be allowed to say what I want to say,\" De Botton said. \"If I see a cockroach coming out of the Carluccio's here then I should be able to write about it. BAA used to be so guarded as an organisation, but they have thrown open their doors to me.\" The results of his week's stint at Terminal Five will be published by Profile Books next month, with BAA distributing 10,000 copies free to passengers. The airport's chief operating officer, Mike Brown, said: \"Opening Heathrow to literary critique is a bold and adventurous step for us.\" A self-confessed transport obsessive, De Botton said he hoped to \"lift the lid\" on how an airport works. \"I love transport, I love airplanes. It is the opposite of routine, even when it goes wrong,\" he said. \"There are not many industries where you find 20 people camped on your doorstep, like plane and trainspotters, to find out how it works. You will not find people doing that outside Tesco, saying 'look at that chicken tikka arriving.' People are fascinated by this and I share that fascination.\" While De Botton's last book on transport, The Art of Travel, mused on the thoughts of intellectual powerhouses such as TS Eliot, Baudelaire and Nietzsche, the Swiss author said the product of his Heathrow residency would be more journalistic than highbrow. His research so far has encompassed trips to inflight meal maker Gate Gourmet, the terminal's state-of-the-art baggage system, which failed spectacularly last year, and Heathrow's deluxe passenger lounges. Interviews with the chief executives of BAA and British Airways, Heathrow's biggest airline, will also feature in the book. \"This is me with my reportage hat on rather than my philosophical hat. There will be some ideas, but it will be a Nietzsche-free zone,\" he said. \"I want it to be like those kids' books where you see inside a Norman castle, like a cutaway. There are many places in the modern world that we do not understand because we cannot get inside them. Like nuclear power stations, there are lots of places important to the life cycle that we cannot get into.\" De Botton's prominent position in the middle of the terminal's departure hall has already seen the writer-in-residence assume a more hands-on role. \"I do get asked where the toilets are. And I can answer many of the passengers' questions,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2009/jan/02/nuclear-war-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-02T14:24:53Z","webTitle":"Duncan Clark on the carbon footprint of nuclear war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/jan/02/nuclear-war-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2009/jan/02/nuclear-war-emissions","fields":{"headline":"The carbon footprint of nuclear war","bodyText":"Just when you might have thought it was ethically sound to unleash a nuclear attack on a nearby city, along comes a pesky scientist and points out that atomic warfare is bad for the climate. According to a new paper in the journal Energy &amp; Environmental Science, even a very limited nuclear exchange, using just a thousandth of the weaponry of a full-scale nuclear war, would cause up to 690m tonnes of CO2 to enter the atmosphere – more than UK's annual total. The upside (kind of) is that the conflict would also generate as much as 313m tonnes of soot. This would stop a great deal of sunlight reaching the earth, creating a significant regional cooling effect in the short and medium terms – just like when a major volcano erupts. Ultimately, though, the CO2 would win out and crank up global temperatures an extra few notches. The paper's author, Mark Z Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, calculated the emissions of such a conflict by totting up the burn rate and carbon content of the fabric of our cities. \"Materials have the following carbon contents: plastics, 38–92%; tyres and other rubbers, 59–91%; synthetic fibres, 63–86%; woody biomass, 41–45%; charcoal, 71%; asphalt, 80%; steel, 0.05–2%. We approximate roughly the carbon content of all combustible material in a city as 40–60%.\" But why would a Stanford engineer bother calculating such a thing? Given that the nuclear exchange would also kill up to 17 million people, who's going to be thinking about the impact on global warming? The purpose of the paper is to compare the total human and environmental costs of a wide range of different power sources, from solar and wind to nuclear and biofuels. One of the side-effects of nuclear power, the report argues, is an increased risk of nuclear war: \"Because the production of nuclear weapons material is occurring only in countries that have developed civilian nuclear energy programs, the risk of a limited nuclear exchange between countries or the detonation of a nuclear device by terrorists has increased due to the dissemination of nuclear energy facilities worldwide.\" \"As such,\" Jacobson continues, \"it is a valid exercise to estimate the potential number of immediate deaths and carbon emissions due to the burning of buildings and infrastructure associated with the proliferation of nuclear energy facilities and the resulting proliferation of nuclear weapons … Although concern at the time of an explosion will be the deaths and not carbon emissions, policy makers today must weigh all the potential future risks of mortality and carbon emissions when comparing energy sources.\" I'm not a huge fan of nuclear energy, and I agree that a large roll-out of atomic power must on some level increase the likelihood of nuclear terrorism or war. However, it does strike me as faintly absurd to try and quantify this risk – particularly the way Jacobson does it. Here's how he crunches the numbers: \"If one nuclear exchange as described above occurs over the next 30 years, the net carbon emissions due to nuclear weapons proliferation caused by the expansion of nuclear energy worldwide would be 1.1–4.1g CO2 per kWh, where the energy generation assumed is the annual 2005 generation for nuclear power multiplied by the number of year being considered.\" In other words, if nuclear power leads one exchange of fifty 15 kilotonne nuclear devices over 30 years, then that equates to 4.1 grams of extra CO2 for each kilowatt of nuclear energy produced. Why, you might ask, has Jacobson chosen one exchange, 50 nuclear war heads and 30 years? Good question. Those figures, as far as I can tell, are entirely arbitrary, and as such I'm rather surprised that the Royal Society for Chemistry are prepared to publish them in their journal. Putting those doubts to one side for a moment, it's interesting to note that nuclear looks very bad in the report even if you ignore the warfare component of the carbon footprint. Far more serious (by a factor of 15 to 25) is nuclear's opportunity cost: the emissions savings lost during the decades of planning and building of each nuclear station. Once again, however, there's no explanation about how these figures are calculated, so it's hard to know whether they're valid. Either way, nuclear doesn't come out as badly as first- or second-generation biofuels. These, the author remarks, are \"ranked lowest overall and with respect to climate, air pollution, land use, wildlife damage, and chemical waste,\" and may actually \"worsen climate and air pollution\" relative to fossil fuels. Carbon capture and storage also gets a thumbs down. By contrast, wind, solar and marine energy score well on the wide-ranging criteria, which include carbon emissions, land demands and even thermal pollution. As the first study to compare energy sources in so many different ways, the report is both interesting and welcome. Unfortunately, it's unlikely to make much of an impact – not just because there's no mention of the economics of each energy source, but because the half-baked quantification of nuclear war's climate impact makes the whole study seem somewhat unconvincing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/nov/27/alexander-chancellor-bank-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-27T00:05:17Z","webTitle":"No one trusts bankers any more.

For as long as I can remember, we shared with estate agents the shame of being in the least trusted of all occupations. But then came the credit crunch and the parliamentary expenses scandal, and the order of ignominy changed. According to the last survey I saw, we are now more trusted then either bankers or politicians. Estate agents have retained their rightful place at the bottom of the table, but now share it not with journalists but with politicians, both of them enjoying the trust of only 1% of the population. A few more people, 2%, still have faith in bankers. Journalists, on the other hand, are trusted by 3%. Not enough, I agree, to put a swagger in one's step, but pretty encouraging all the same. Surveys show, in fact, that the British don't trust anybody much except for the Queen, Stephen Fry and Jamie Oliver. They revere celebrities but distrust almost all professionals except for teachers and doctors, in whom they dare not lose faith. And it could be their need to believe not only in the people who look after their children and their health but also in those who look after their money that explains the marginally higher standing of bankers than that of politicians. For by any objective standard, bankers have behaved much more disgracefully than MPs, who are novices in the business of self-enrichment. Only a few have been particularly corrupt, most are remorseful, and none has done much harm to anybody else (one possible exception being ducks, as demand for elegant duck islands has reportedly dried up because of the taint of scandal attaching to them). Bankers, on the other hand, not only destroyed the livelihood of millions with their greed but have felt not the slightest shame about it. Even after being bailed out by the taxpayer at vast cost, they have continued to pay themselves huge bonuses. Lord Myners, the City minister (and a former City fat cat himself), professes himself \"astonished by the thickness of the skins\" of those who still refuse to contemplate restrictions on their earnings. And according to Sir David Walker, the author of a government report into the banking industry, bank employees earning more than £1m a year number \"certainly\" hundreds \"but possibly thousands\". Yet banks pursue a vindictive policy towards those driven to exceed their overdraft limits by charging them as much as £35 for every bounced cheque, £25 a month, and another £25 every time their overdrafts go up (a monstrous practice just approved by the supreme court). Then they use this income to subsidise the costs involved in looking after their richer clients. It's the mirror image of Germany's \"Robin Hood\" banker who, for no personal gain, transferred £7m from the accounts of rich clients to pay off the unauthorised overdrafts of poor ones. She has been ruined as a result. Confusion and climate change My hunch is that the next group of professionals to sink lower than journalists in public esteem will be scientists after the scandal at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. Leaked emails seemed to show that researchers there not only wanted to suppress any information that might undermine their gloomy predictions on climate change, but even that they weren't themselves quite confident of them. About an apparent fall in global warming since 2001, one of the emails said: \"The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it's a travesty that we can't.\" The potential damage of these leaks is hard to exaggerate, for nobody wants to believe in man-made global warming unless they have to. The steps demanded to halt it are immensely expensive and incredibly tiresome in everyday life. On the one hand, we are asked to accept a whole new generation of nuclear power stations, hideous wind farms all over the countryside, and solar panels covering the Sahara desert; on the other, we must recycle our rubbish, install double glazing, change our central heating boilers, and so on. When even the American and Chinese governments take global warming seriously, and pledge themselves to make huge cuts in carbon emissions, we have to take notice. But everything depends on a supposed consensus among the world's scientific experts, and the East Anglian emails lead one to doubt its existence. Oh, how nice it would be if the whole worry would just go away. It is so tempting to listen to the siren voices of people such as Lord Lawson, the former chancellor of the exchequer, who preaches eco-scepticism. Nothing seems certain in this controversial field. And faith in the doomsayers does not grow when they tell us that our duty is to eat fewer sausages. How (not) to wear shorts During the Queen's visit to Bermuda, her husband was presented with a paid of bright green Bermuda shorts; and it is to Prince Philip's credit that he received the gift with little enthusiasm. He would not be putting them on straight away, he said. Quite right. In fact, he should never put them on. It is my firm belief that, out of respect for the aesthetic sensibilities of others, it is the duty of any man over school-leaving age not to wear shorts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2007/may/21/immigrationpolicy.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-21T08:49:40Z","webTitle":"Holyrood to clash with Westminster over nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/21/immigrationpolicy.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2007/may/21/immigrationpolicy.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Holyrood to clash with Westminster over nuclear power","bodyText":"The Scottish parliament and Westminster are on a collision course over nuclear power, green campaigners claimed today.

The findings came ahead of the Westminster government's energy white paper on Wednesday, which is expected to say new nuclear stations are essential for Britain's energy requirements and hitting carbon emission targets. The first minister, Alex Salmond, has insisted there is no prospect of new nuclear stations in Scotland. He told the BBC's Politics Show yesterday: \"As far as Scotland is concerned, I think we'll be saying: 'Nuclear power - no thanks'. \"There's absolutely no chance of us allowing a new generation of nuclear power in Scotland. \"There is just no consensus in Scottish society or in the Scottish parliament to have foisted on us another generation of nuclear power stations.\" The trade and industry secretary, Alistair Darling, told the same programme: \"I certainly started off as a sceptic, as far as nuclear was concerned. \"But I think that if we don't keep that open as an option, then we're not going to be able to reach our targets to reduce the amount of carbon going in to the atmosphere, and we have run a grave risk of not having our electricity when we need it.\" Friends of the Earth said the energy white paper looked like putting Westminster on a collision course with the Scottish parliament. FoE Scotland chief executive Duncan McLaren said: \"Should Gordon Brown attempt to implement Blair's radioactive legacy - by imposing nuclear power stations on Scotland - he can now be sure it will be met with stiff opposition. \"The results of our survey couldn't be clearer - new nuclear power stations are not welcome in Scotland. \"Like the public, the majority of MSPs realise that nuclear power is nothing other than a white elephant.\" He went on: \"Any attempt to foist new nuclear power on Scotland would be an expensive, ineffective and risky distraction from sensible measures to address climate change. \"Continued investment in energy efficiency and clean renewables are the only sure fire ways to reduce Scotland's climate change emissions.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/dan-roberts-on-business-blog/2009/nov/23/cbi-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-23T11:05:48Z","webTitle":"CBI annual conference: business and party leaders debate the economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/dan-roberts-on-business-blog/2009/nov/23/cbi-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/dan-roberts-on-business-blog/2009/nov/23/cbi-conference","fields":{"headline":"CBI annual conference: business and party leaders debate the economy","bodyText":"11.03am: It's not often that all three political leaders share the same stage, let alone on the economy: arguably the defining issue of the next election. Let's hope the CBI conference forces them to spell out their plans. Gordon Brown is finally in a confrontational mood, threatening to ratchet up his pressure for a transaction tax on the City. David Cameron has yet to seal the deal with the business community and Nick Clegg is riding high after weekend talk of a hung parliament. First up, Gordon Brown. 11.06am: Brown reminds the hall that this all started with the global financial crisis - ie. them, not him. 11.08am: Choking off the recovery prematurely would be fatal He's talking to you David. 11.12am: First mention of a global financial levy, but only as a list of options. This it not yet the determined defence of a Tobin tax we were promised. 11.14am: Rising deficits are an inevitable consequence of the events of the last few years, but we are one of the first governments to announce plans to tackle them. An important issue for the captains of industry in the hall, but barely a peep out of them. He'll have to do better than that. 11.18am: More pledges to support new nuclear power; more broadband investment, more transport infrastructure etc etc. This is exactly what the business community wants to hear, but it doesn't exactly chime with the CBI's wish to get the public deficit down. I wonder why Brown doesn't make more of the irony. 11.22am: So far, it's a scatter gun list of government policy rather than a direct appeal for the support of the business community that Brown used to indulge in. I wonder if he's already given up on this constituency in his head? 11.23am: Big section on Europe from Brown. Another challenge to Cameron, who has to convince the CBI that he won't isolate British business from its biggest market. 11.27am: Finally, an announcement: an international investment conference in London next year. Some polite applause and then time for questions. 11.33am: Brown challenged on small business taxation. Tax breaks became a vehicle for tax avoidance, he insists, that's why they had to change. 11.36am: CBI chair Helen Alexander says questions have to be \"very, very quick\". Brown mumbles that he has plenty of time, only to be politely informed that it's not his time they're worried about. Ouch. 11.38am: Brown says the government is setting out more plans for high speed rail in the next few weeks. Music to the ears of the CBI crowd from Manchester and Birmingham who now have to trudge down to London for their annual shindig after it stopped moving around the country last year. 11.40am: Alexander says that's it Gordon - time to get off. Polite applause, but there are other politicians to hear from now... 11.42am: Nick Clegg strides in, looking altogether more chipper after the weekend polling. His first address to the CBI as Lib Dem leader. 11.45am: Time to revisit the fundamentals of banking, says Clegg: What are they for? Good question, so rarely asked. 11.47am: It is unacceptable that when taxpayers own so much of the banking industry, credit still isn't flowing to small businesses. Taxpayers shouldn't just be suggesting a change of policy, they should be insisting on it. For a good chunk of the CBI audience, this is a really sore point. Business leaders seem less willing to challenge the City on this one though - curious. 11.50am: Clegg revisits the question of a levy on banking, adding one more detail than Brown did: he wants a windfall tax set at 10%. That's it though - no detail, no explanation. Funny how neither Brown nor Clegg choose to dwell on this question. They'd be surprised how many industrialists are actually with them on this one. 11.52am: A bit more on the banking levy - Clegg reckons a temporary tax on bank profits will raise about £2bn. That sounds pretty small beer given what others have been talking about. 11.56am: Clegg also talking about spending more than cuts, insisting that it would be \"economic madness\" to cut back on infrastructure investment at this point. There's definitely been a change in mood on this from politicians in recent days. Even Cameron has been talking about a budget for growth rather than an austerity budget once the Tories are in power. I wonder if the slash and burn talk has peaked? 12.01pm: Time for some more feisty questions from floor. Clegg asked to clarify his references to \"unearned wealth\" and \"avoiding the trap of cutting public spending\". He pauses long and hard, \"erm\". 12.02pm: Ok. Clegg dives in feet first and says that property is an example of unearned wealth, alluding to Vince Cable's plan to tax it more. Stony silence from the audience. Brave stuff, though. 12.08pm: Clegg challenged on nuclear power now. He's getting a really hard time from this audience. Brown gets a backhanded compliment when a delegate suggests he has more of a vision for business than the Lib Dems. 12.12pm: I have clearly failed miserably to be the slightest bit uplifting and visionary, admits Clegg, getting the first titter of the day from a very stony-faced audience. 12.15pm: Cameron gets a much warmer reception. Alexander says the CBI has continued to build its relationship with the Conservative party over the past year. 12.16pm: You wait ages for one party leader and then three turn up at once. Cameron actually raises a laugh from the audience. 12.25pm: Within 50 days of taking office, the Tories will announce an emergency growth budget, with plans to bring down the deficit, but also initiatives to stimulate business with lower taxes - a neat trick, if he can pull it off. 12.27pm: Cameron claims that the government's need to borrow money is already crowding out private sector investment, pointing to the market-beating interest rates on offer at National Savings &amp; Investment. Nobody seems to have told him that these were pulled over the weekend . Shame, it would have been an interesting point, had it been true. 12.31pm: The relationship between the CBI and a political party should never be entirely smooth, we should have the odd argument, but frankness matters more than ever because the government has run out of money. He's treading the tightrope between playing to the gallery and not appearing to pander. Big applause. 12.32pm: We've got plenty of time to take questions and answers, says Cameron with a smile that suggests he saw Brown's uncomfortable moment being bundled off the stage earlier. 12.40pm: Cameron faces questions again on Tory plans to replace the FSA's supervision of the banks with a beefed up Bank of England. Business is still not convinced about this one. 12.44pm: Now Cameron is facing tougher questioning on his plans to scrap Regional Development Agencies, a big issue for CBI members outside London who rate these rather more highly than the politicians do. He appears to put his foot in it for the first time with a remarkably glib answer: I don't think Britain does have very strong regional identities I suspect the spin doctors might want to polish this argument a bit more. 12.48pm: Cameron quits while he's still ahead and ends the Q&amp;A to warm applause. I'm going to take a break for lunch now and return later on to see what the business chaps have to say. Stuart Rose from M&amp;S and Stephen Hester from RBS are both up after 1pm. 1.54pm: After an undignified scrum over the hot buffet, Britain's business leaders are back to listen to some of their own rather than the politicians. On the panel now is Stuart Rose of M&amp;S, Stephen Hester (Britain's best paid civil servant), the boss of outsourcing giant Serco and (a special guest speaker) the US boss of Pfizer, who has just reminded us that his company is the largest single supplier of drugs to the NHS. 1.57pm: The spirit of trust between business and the public has evaporated, says Jeff Kindler, Pfizer's chief executive. He might not be as dull as he sounds. 2.02pm: The people we serve are angry. People have come to believe that the rules meant to bring order to society are meant to benefit those that make the rules. People have had enough and the backlash is real. Sometimes this criticism is warranted and sometimes it is not, but when the majority of people don't trust you, they will find a way to make you do what they want. This chap from Pfizer is good at diagnosis, not sure where he's going with the cure though. 2.14pm: Pfizer's research centre in Kent is the largest privately-owned medical research facility in the world, apparently. 2.21pm: Stephanie Flanders conducts a straw poll of the CBI audience to see how many are feeling that the economy is ready to start to recovering: about 3 people put their hands up. This is a pretty gloomy room. 2.22pm: Hester is one of the few bankers we can get to come out in daylight hours, quips Flanders. 2.24pm: Hester says thank you to the CBI for the bail-outs. We are crystal clear that we would not be here were it not for the support from the government and the taxpayer. 2.30pm: We are able to lend to exactly the same proportion of customers as we did before the crisis. A very carefully-worded boast that is no doubt meant to reassure, but I wonder how many of the business people in the audience feel that lending condtions are quite as rosy as RBS makes out? 2.32pm: Stuart Rose can't resist trying to sell. Not sure how many of the audience are interested in his dine-in-for-£10 offers though. 2.33pm: Stuart Rose on the environment: There was a time at M&amp;S when the only green we knew was Philip Green. Ho ho 2.40pm: Chris Hyam presents Serco and its ilk as the answer to the world's public sector deficits. Spending restraint can be a catalyst for transformational change, but we need bravery too. For too long we have seen the delivery of public services based on the needs of the provider rather than the user. Can't help but think we're going to be hearing a lot more of this sort of stuff over the next couple of years. 2.57pm: My colleague Allegra Stratton helpfully passes on an interesting complaint from Labour about David Cameron's attempt to enlist international support for his economic policies. Earlier on today, Cameron implied that the OECD and President Obama were backing his view that cutting public deficits now was the best way to strengthen the economy. Labour's one-man rebutal unit, Peter Mandelson, points out that the OECD was talking about reducing deficits only \"once the recovery takes hold\" and that Obama has also warned about the dangers of governments doing too little. It might sound like splitting hairs, but this issue of timing is going to be one of the big dividing lines of the next few months. 3.02pm: Stephen Hester touches on one of the big questions for politicians: do the tax rules encourage companies to take on too much debt? It is true that thanks to the tax system there is a very big difference in the cost of debt and the cost of equity and you could argue this played a big part in what happened. Stuart Rose agrees that it is a problem. So when is the CBI going to start the campaign? 3.05pm: They're close to wrapping up now and I'm heading off. My colleague Kathryn Hopkins is sticking around to hear what Adair Turner has to say. More thoughts from me later on what it all means."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/may/30/keeponthesunnyside1","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-30T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"Keep on the sunny side","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/30/keeponthesunnyside1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/may/30/keeponthesunnyside1","fields":{"headline":"Keep on the sunny side","bodyText":"Gordon Brown's further raising of his nuclear new-build ambitions (this time setting out how he'd like to expand the number of stations above what we have now) demonstrates to me a huge imagination gap at the highest level of government. Identifying truly sustainability solutions is often about joining up lots of different dots - for example, relating to economic and social benefits, technological choices and ecological capacities, all combined in one overall calculation. If, on the subject of nuclear power, we examine the negative dots of cost, radioactive waste, proliferation and the amount of time it will take to do it, and then compare those with the positive dots of new jobs, real energy security, peace, development and technological innovation, then it seems they don't join up. If you do try to join the dots, I believe a different answer should be reached: namely, renewables and energy efficiency, including combined heat and power. As far as renewable technologies are concerned, I will be speaking at Hay on Sunday about a technology called Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). This is basically a means of using mirrors to harness sunshine to boil liquids, in order to generate electricity. We presently heat water to do this with coal, gas and uranium. All of these have serious drawbacks, however, many of which could be overcome by using the sun instead. I guess a lot of people might believe that this technology is somehow new and untested and that we should instead go for tried-and-tested technologies - such as nuclear power. But this would be a false assumption. I was shown two days ago a photograph of a CSP plant being tried out in a north African desert. It wasn't taken in 2005, but in 1914! Yes, this technology has been around a long time. I suspect the reason it is not flourishing already is because you can't make weapons of mass destruction as a byproduct, or make billions out of mining rare ores as an essential feedstock. CSP has awesome potential, including for us here in northern Europe with stations along the fringes of North Africa, supplying power through new and efficient high-voltage cabling which reduces power losses over long distances to under 10% of that generated. It works in Europe, too, and there is already an operational station near Seville in Spain. On a global scale, just a few per cent of the sunniest deserts could generate the equivalent of present global electricity demand. It's huge, or it could be, so long as the policies are there to make it happen. But they are not, and while Gordon Brown now seems to utter the N-word whenever he gets the chance, we hear nothing from him about the truly sustainable technologies that are not only good for power, but good for jobs, development and peace too. A real case of joining the dots that politicians should be right behind. On Sunday I'll be talking on a platform here with Paul Brown, the Guardian's former environment editor, who will examine the modern case for nuclear power, based in part on the facts of its past performance. Friends of the Earth published a report today authored by Paul on this subject, which sets out a very clear case as to why we should not expect Gordon Brown's nuclear dream to ever be fulfilled, and certainly not through the freemarket framework within which, he insists, his policy will be located. On the contrary, the nuclear project that Gordon Brown is hell-bent on pursuing will, if it ever gets going, cost us many, and perhaps hundreds, of billions of pounds. We are already committed to £70bn worth of costs for the clean-up of the existing nuclear programme. Committing us to more of the same is, economically speaking, quite mad. Going down the renewables and efficiency route will give us more jobs, more power and more security and, in the long term, for less money. But if Gordon Brown is really convinced that nuclear energy is essential, then perhaps there might still be time at least to get him to go for the safest source of that power: by harnessing a massive fusion reactor that won't generate waste or ever melt down. It's 93m miles away, and its called the sun.

Brown knew his premiership was at an end, and had wanted for some hours to go to Buckingham Palace to see her to tender his resignation. But the palace said No. Protocol suggested that he must wait for the call from Nick Clegg, telling him he had struck a deal with the Conservative party. One minister inside the bunker in the final hours said: \"I'm annoyed, relieved and I want to clear off. We are just waiting for Nick Clegg to stop dicking around.\" The remarks were a reflection of the bitter recriminations that broke out as Labour negotiators with the Lib Dems accused Clegg's team of proposing ludicrous spending pledges, and Clegg himself of obstructing talks. They claimed that an effort to open direct discussions this morning between the more sympathetic Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, and Alistair Darling, the Labour chancellor for three years, had been vetoed by the Lib Dem leader. Some Labour negotiators involved in two rounds of talks on Monday afternoon and this morning said they had not thought that any insurmountable policy difference was going to block agreement between the two sides. Instead, they believe the growing opposition inside the Labour party, including from vocal former ministers and some MPs angry at what they regarded as the lack of consultation, confirmed Clegg in his view that a Lib Dem-Labour coalition would be not just be illegitimate, but instable. In what may turn into a vicious political battle between Labour and Lib Dems in the weeks ahead, some were pinning the blame entirely on Clegg, calling him \"a Tory in all but name\". One Labour negotiator hotly denied that there had been divisions within the Labour negotiating team, or that they had displayed bad body language. Ed Balls said the Liberal Democrats had switched position on whether an emergency budget should be introduced this year. \"We tried to negotiate in good faith. David Laws said he wanted to go with deficit reduction and cuts in spending this year, and that is not something we could agree with. \"If we had gone to the cabinet and to the parliamentary party and said cut spending now – which is contrary to our manifesto – they would have said no\". Cable denied this account. But tonight that was certainly the Labour view of why a day that had started with such high hopes of a Lib Dem-Labour coalition had ended with David Cameron in Downing Street. According to Labour, there were other key sticking points, and demands from the Liberal Democrats that simply could not be met. The Lib Dems had apparently asked for an extra £2.5bn to spend on the school pupil premium to be spent on poorer children. Labour argued that it was not against the idea, but asked how it could be funded. There were also divisions over electoral reform. On Monday, the Lib Dems had demanded that the alternative vote system for electing MPs be passed by parliament – and that if an election occurred before a referendum, the election would be held under AV. They also wanted a fully proportional system to be offered in a referendum. Labour flatly refused to introduce AV without a referendum, saying it would be illegitimate. On the environment, the Lib Dems wanted no new nuclear power stations and to increase the proportion of energy from renewables from 15% to 40% by 2020. Labour also eventually agreed to drop the third runway at Heathrow being agreed in the next parliament and any hint of compulsory identity cards. Labour said it was even willing to look at Cable's pet idea of taking people earning less than £10,000 out of tax altogether, but said a way had to be found to fund a tax switch that might cost £17bn and anyway not help the poorest the most. Exasperated by the demands, Labour claimed that the total spending pledges being sought by the Liberal Democrats amounted to £20bn. A Labour negotiator said: \"The body language and mood was fine. The idea being put about by the Liberal Democrats that Ed Balls was sneering or not serious is simply not true. \"I am not sure there was any single policy show-stopper, but they just wanted to go in with the Conservatives in the end. I think they are too relaxed about the consequences of that alliance for them. I would not like to be a Liberal Democrat activist on the doorstep explaining what his leadership has done.\" Some of the Labour negotiating team denied that the leadership would have been unable to deliver the parliamentary party to the deal, saying the head of steam against coalition in Labour ranks could have been contained. But that underestimated the growing political and emotional aversion to a deal with the Lib Dems on Labour benches. That rebellion was launched on Sky News at the unlikely hour of 3am on Friday – election night – and the flag of opposition was unfurled by the unlikely figure of the former home secretary David Blunkett, normally a loyalist. Responding to the news that the Tories were chalking up swings of 8% against Labour, mainly in the north-east, Blunkett said the game was up for his party, telling his colleagues to throw away his party pagers that suggested Labour had not lost. Initially his take was that such a result would require the Labour party to go into opposition, to start looking outwards, and learn the lessons of the defeat. Blunkett told the Guardian today that his remarks that night \"led to a comradely expression of views from Downing Street, followed by a comradely expression of views by myself\". He admitted today that at the time he had felt lonely in both his judgment of the election results and its consequences. \"It was difficult and painful for me, and I know people will say I played a role in putting Labour into opposition, but in the end you have to accept the legitimacy of the electorate. If we can regroup we will be ready for an election in a year's time.\" Blunkett carried on expressing his view during an interview on Sunday, leading to a phone call from John Reid, another former home secretary. Reid told Blunkett that he intended to condemn the idea of a \"coalition of the losers\" in interviews as well. Reid is not a natural pluralist – indeed, he favours abolition of the House of Lords – but his condemnatory language was extreme, describing a Liberal Democrat-Labour deal as mutually assured destruction, and adding: \" If we continue not listening then we will lose very badly at any subsequent election.\" Such has been the anger at these two men's behaviour that one cabinet minister said coldly: \"I hope I never have to meet those two again.\" Jack Straw, the justice secretary and a long-time foe of the Liberal Democrats, was also deeply unhappy. Straw had been privately fed up with the tone of the election campaign run by Lord Mandelson, telling friends that it had sent out too many warm signals to the Lib Dems, confusing Labour voters in Lib Dem-Labour marginals. Straw had argued repeatedly in private to Brown after the election that Labour had lost, and just had to recognise that, if anyone had won, it was the Tories. Labour had won 60 fewer seats than the Labour government of 1964 to 1970 and if a progressive government had been formed, it would have led a hand-to-mouth existence. The coalition would have collapsed, leading to recriminations and anger within the party, Straw argued. Figures such as Andy Burnham, the health secretary and a long-term cabinet opponent of electoral reform, also voiced his doubts in public. In a delphic radio interview today he hinted at his private doubts, saying: \"I think you have got to respect the result of the general election and that we have lost.\" Critics of the planned Lib Dem-Labour deal said there had not been enough consultation with Labour MPs. But those involved in the clandestine discussions over the past few days said there had to be secrecy, partly because Clegg had said he must talk to the Conservatives first. By afternoon the rebellion was gathering strength. Phil Woolas, the immigration minister and a figure who has fought the Liberal Democrats to a standstill in his constituency, told the Guardian: \"I am not going to join a terrible marriage or go into a government with Chris Huhne. \"We have not got a moral mandate to govern. We might have been able to run an arithmetical government, but it would not be a real government. The Liberal Democrats in my part of the world are surrogate Tories, and if you speak to the Labour MPs that is the view of two thirds of them.\" By mid-afternoon the die was cast. Labour knew its chances of a fourth term, for long an impossible dream, and fleetingly an unexpected possibility, had evaporated, a victim of the electorate's judgment, the Lib Dems, and Labour's own refusal to take the risk of an alliance with Nick Clegg. By mid-evening, Brown was no longer prime minister, and instead a private citizen – possibly the most brutal life change any individual can suffer. • This article was amended on 13 May 2010.

Regulators are concerned they have not been furnished with some design details of the Olkiluoto 3 plant and warn the timetable of the delayed project will be further affected if nothing is done. \"I want to express my great concern on the lack of progress in the design of Olkiluoto 3 NPP [nuclear power plant] automation ... The systems with highest safety performance are to be designed by Areva... but unfortunately the attitude or lack of professional knowledge of some persons who speak in the expert meetings on behalf of that organisation prevent progress in resolving the concerns,\" says Jukka Laaksonen, director general of STUK, Finland's radiation and nuclear safety authority, in a letter to Anne Lauvergeon, Areva's chief executive. \"Without a proper design that meets the basic principles of nuclear safety ... I see no possibility to approve these important systems for installations,\" he adds in the letter, dated last December. Concerns over Areva's performance in Finland will raise new fears among opponents over the viability of any newbuild programme in Britain. Areva says the letter was simply part of a regular question and answer process under which safety issues were dealt with. \"These issues will not involve additional delays,\" said a spokesman. But Areva admitted that the scheme, already believed to be three years late, still has no definite new opening date. In December, before the letter was sent to the French by STUK, Areva accused its Finnish client, power company TVO, of failing to make progress on measures to speed up the passing of technical details to the safety authorities there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/12/recession-threatens-global-warming-measures","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-11T23:06:10Z","webTitle":"Recession 'threatens UK effort to tackle global warming'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/12/recession-threatens-global-warming-measures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/12/recession-threatens-global-warming-measures","fields":{"headline":"Recession 'threatens UK effort to tackle global warming'","bodyText":"The recession is threatening the vast investment needed in green housing, power and transport and could seriously undermine Britain's efforts to meet its targets for tackling global warming, the government's climate change advisers warn today. The UK already has the toughest climate change laws in the world but the Committee on Climate Change says that \"radical\" action is still needed. It highlights the need to rescue carbon trading schemes – a key weapon in the battle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – from problems caused by the slump. The committee demands \"dramatic improvements\" in the carbon efficiency of cars and measures to cut the growth in traffic, potentially including road pricing. It recommends that there should be 1.7m electric cars, with 3.9m drivers trained in fuel-efficient techniques, by 2020. Europe is relying on carbon trading between polluters to make it cheaper to build wind turbines and develop technology to trap and store gases from power stations as part of a promised switch to a low-carbon economy. The committee also warns that a \"step change\" is needed in the pace of UK emissions reductions if the government is to stick to tough new carbon budgets. Annual cuts must increase by at least four times, from the recent rate of 0.5% to 2-3%.The report also demands \"more forceful\" policy approaches. Lord Turner, chair of the committee, said: \"The government needs to build on its low-carbon transition plan and put in place a comprehensive delivery framework. What we have proposed is achievable and affordable, but action needs to be taken now if we are to make our contribution to combating climate change.\" Andy Atkins, head of Friends of the Earth, said: \"The Climate Change Act is a world-class piece of legislation, but the true test is the policies put in place to deliver its goals. Crucial strategies on fossil fuels, aviation and energy infrastructure, due out shortly, will demonstrate whether or not the government has heeded the committee's warnings.\" With greater effort, the committee says, Britain could be transformed. It calls for a nationwide programme to boost energy efficiency in homes and offices, similar in scale to the installation of natural gas in every house from the late 1960s.It wants to see 10m lofts insulated by 2015 and 12m old boilers replaced by energy-efficient versions by 2022, as well as \"significantly\" increased numbers of energy-efficient washing machines and refrigerators. New laws may be needed to force private landlords to insulate and upgrade rented homes, the report says. The CCC says Britain should slash emissions from the power sector by 50% before 2020 by building 8,000 new wind turbines, alongside four new coal power stations fitted with carbon capture technology and three new nuclear power plants. It also calls for an urgent overhaul of the national grid, to accommodate new windfarms. The report says: \"In a world where carbon budgets are achieved, we will meet more of our energy needs from low carbon power, live in well insulated homes with energy efficient boilers and appliances. We will also work in energy efficient offices and drive more carbon efficient cars including hybrids and electric vehicles.\" David Kennedy, chief executive of the committee, said the recession could demolish such plans. \"It's a very big problem,\" he said. The fall in economic activity has lowered CO2 emissions in Europe and left companies in the EU's emissions trading scheme with a surplus of carbon credits. The committee estimates this could result in a carbon price of just €20 a tonne in 2020, rather than the €50 a tonne used for its previous analysis. Options to strengthen the carbon price, including the government underwriting a minimum price or intervening in the electricity market, should be \"seriously considered\", the committee says. On Friday, a report from Ofgem suggesting domestic energy bills could rise 14-60% by 2020 was seen by energy industry experts as an acceptance that the market-driven system has failed and the government needs to be more interventionist. The analysis comes as a separate report from the Aldersgate group of companies says that a more radical approach to financing low carbon projects is needed to ensure carbon targets are met. It argues that a new strategic approach to reduce investor risks, mobilise capital and streamline institutional structures would accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and reduce costs. Emma Howard Boyd, head of socially responsible investment and governance at Jupiter Asset Management, said: \"There remains a credibility gap between policy and delivery which has resulted in too much uncertainty and risk for investors to finance at the scale that is required.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/sep/22/rochdale-seven-conrad-black","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-21T23:15:03Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/22/rochdale-seven-conrad-black","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/sep/22/rochdale-seven-conrad-black","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"And so severe judgment has been passed on the seven Labour party members accused of gross misconduct in the badlands of Rochdale. Five were expelled after a hearing into allegations, strongly denied, that they bullied the party and its colourful candidate Simon Danczuk; two more were suspended, but they immediately resigned anyway. A couple of longstanding members, one a former mayor, have torn up their party cards in the immediate aftermath. More, it is said, will follow. The trial followed a letter written by the seven in January demanding an investigation into allegations, hotly contested, which relate to Mr Danczuk's personal life. Party officials, however, say the misbehaviour started long before that. \"After listening to all sides, the National Constitutional Committee has ruled,\" a spokesman said, emphasising that its members are independent. The prediction now is difficult days ahead, perhaps a legal action by the candidate against a local website, certainly more soap opera; for Rochdale's contribution to the dog days of New Labour never seems to rise above that of ghoulish entertainment. Liberal Democrat MP Paul Rowen may look on and feel that his 1,000-vote majority has never been more safe. Is there nothing to stop John Woodcock, the latest to be catapulted into public life from the launch pad that is No 10? He seems a shoo-in for the soon to be vacant seat for Barrow and Furness, and little wonder. Look at his friends. He's now a special adviser to Gordon but before that the former journalist was special adviser to John Hutton, the Barrow MP and former energy secretary who is stepping down at the next election to spend more time with his consultancy at French firm EDF. Last week, Woodcock received a slew of key endorsements from local branches. There are other candidates, but he is on his way. David Miliband travelled a similar path in South Shields, and perhaps the only thing to stop the next man on the conveyor belt will turn out to be the electorate. South Shields is rock-solid Labour, whereas the projected Tory landslide would see Barrow fall to the Conservatives. Still, expect him to be there when it counts. And what next for Edward McMillan-Scott, the refusenik MEP who no longer has the brotherhood of the Conservative party to cling to? Homeless, rootless, and all because he scuppered David Cameron's plan to bestow the vice-presidency of the European parliament on to the dodgy Polish MEP Michal Kaminsky. It's cold out there, for sure. But McMillan-Scott will survive. In Brussels, Labour MEPs are grouped on the 13th floor of office block G, along with the Socialists and Democrats. And now McMillan-Scott is there with them. It wasn't what he wanted, but in time he'll think about the Tory-led rabble of homophobes and extremists he left behind, and smile. Today's the day, for the Lib Dems vowed to fight the proliferation of nuclear power plants in the UK. A chance to enhance the party's anti-nuclear credentials. But not all agree. Yesterday, Phil Willis, chairman of the parliamentary science and technology committee, told a fringe event that \"Liberal party policy is totally wrong and dishonest\". But then last year he said that \"We're just as likely to be hit by an asteroid as we are to have a nuclear disaster.\" The lefties in the party have a problem. His name is Phil. Finally, what a long, unwanted period of seclusion this is for Conrad Black. Six-and-a-half years in a Florida prison for fraud and obstruction of justice. No wonder the mind wanders to his mansion in Toronto, another life, a better time. \"In my mind's eye,\" he blogs, \"the view from my terrace there, down to our ravine, traversed by deer, foxes, raccoons and less glamorous animals such as groundhogs and skunks, is a paradisiacal thought. This is especially true now that my wife is there with her menagerie. She dons a pith helmet, mosquito netting to keep the bees she has encouraged from becoming too familiar, and looking a little like Liza Minnelli preparing for her trip to Africa in Cabaret.\" Such thoughts sustain him.

While the industrial action is news in itself, the real story is the madness of closing the only wind turbine manufacturing plant in Britain when the government is committed to generating more green energy. Only last week, Ed Miliband, energy and climate change secretary, announced targets for the generation of green and renewable energy. The workers occupying the Vestas plant on the Isle of Wight pointed out this obvious inconsistency in letting the private owner flout government policy. So too has the workers' union, Unite. Vestas claims that the manufacturing operation is insufficiently profitable – even though its profits continue to grow – and that it exists in too complex a planning environment. Furthermore, it has been cutting back on its wind turbine activities in Britain for some time. In late 2008, it signalled its pullout from its Scottish operation. So the importance of the occupation is not just about action to save jobs at a time when unemployment is continuing to rise steeply. Rather, it is about the necessity to save jobs which are critical to the wider good for society. These jobs could be about delivering vital public services as firefighters do. But, in this case, the issue of the public good is the protection of our environment. Six hundred workers' jobs are under threat on an island where employment is difficult to find. In understanding why the occupation arose, the agitation of the Campaign against Climate Change seems to have played a role in bolstering the workers' understanding of fighting not just to save their jobs but also to make a stand for the environment. But they also seem to have learned that previous protest outside the plant was not sufficient. That's why the occupiers have set up their own website and organised a series of demonstrations. Protests are due to take place in London and the Isle of Wight in order to support the occupation. The real battle is now on as the occupying workers claim they have been threatened with the sack unless they leave the plant and that police have tried to stop supplies of food getting into the plant. To stay in occupation means balancing the fight to save their jobs with the threat of losing their redundancy packages. But it will also mean the need to strengthen the alliance between workers and environmentalists. Unions have often supported expansion of airports (such as the T4 Heathrow terminal) and the continuation of nuclear power on the basis that these create jobs in spite of their environmental costs. So enlarging and deepening such an alliance is not going to be without problems. But it may become easier when the union movement comes to see that the clear determination of environmentalists allows them to take direct action when political lobbying on its own returns slow and sparse results."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/oct/30/high-speed-rail-benefits","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-30T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Carried away with high-speed rail | Stephen Glaister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/oct/30/high-speed-rail-benefits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/oct/30/high-speed-rail-benefits","fields":{"headline":"Carried away with high-speed rail","bodyText":"There are plenty of things divide the main political parties, but there is at least one thing which seems to unite them; their support for a new high-speed rail (HSR) line linking London to the Midlands and beyond, possibly all the way to Scotland. In some cases this enthusiasm has reached almost evangelical zeal. Which is where – despite our pleasure at seeing politicians agree rather than squabble for the sake of it – we at the RAC Foundation start to question that unstinting commitment. Let me say from the outset that the foundation, an independent motoring charity, is not inherently anti-HSR. But we are pro informed choice. And at the moment there seems to be more than a little bit of blind faith associated with the backing of such a scheme. It is to try and add some perspective to the debate that we are publishing a review of the existing literature on HSR ranging from recent studies by Network Rail and Greengauge 21, to a series of seven volumes produced for the Department for Transport back in 2007 which were only made public earlier this year. We have also examined the evidence relating to high-speed lines overseas not least in Europe. It is often claimed that a high-speed network for the UK must be a good thing because so many others have got them. Alas, it is not necessarily so. In his review for us, Professor John Preston of the University of Southampton, declared that there is a business case for a high-speed line and that many of the benefits will be in terms of time saved for rail users. There will also be the advantage of the existing west coast mainline being freed up to allow more space for freight and local services. But not everything is cut and dry. First, there is the environmental impact. Much has been made of HSR's so-called green credentials. Professor Preston concludes that there may be some marginal improvement in the UK's net CO2 emissions, but we would say not nearly enough to justify such a lavish project. Assuming (and this is currently a big assumption) the long term decarbonisation of the nation's energy supply – through greater use of nuclear power and renewable – then most of the environmental impact will occur during the construction phase, which, by the way will not start before 2017 at the earliest, with the first phase of the line not opening before about 2025. Next there is the small matter of the cost of that construction. The research done for the foundation says that for a full-scale high-speed network, the taxpayer will eventually have to foot a bill of as much as £27bn; not an insignificant amount. Now it might be that HSR will pay its way once it's built, with revenue more than matching operation costs. But that is not a given either. Much will depend on the load factor – the ratio of passengers to seats – and the experience on the continent gives highly variable figures. Part of that factor is determined by where the passengers come from. The hope is that eventually, certainly when the high-speed link extends all the way to Scotland, many of the travellers will simply start taking the train where they once used the plane. Similarly there is likely to be a \"modal shift\" to rail from the car. Yet, significantly, about a fifth of passenger trips will be new or \"induced\". Which raises fundamental questions about the role of government – any government – in encouraging the Great British public to travel more than they already do and hence add to the carbon headache. Professor Preston also points out that there has been little analysis of the benefits that might be derived from spending £27bn on other projects. For example, if the main aim of HSR is to save the planet then this amount of money would buy 2.3bn trees to offset carbon emissions (if you bought them through www.carbonfootprint.co.uk). It would also finance the part-purchase of 27m new, low-carbon emitting vehicles via a scrappage scheme offering similar financial incentives to the one currently being run by the government, enough to replace the existing British private car fleet. These illustrations might sound glib and simplistic but they do give a sense of the real choices which have to be made. By the end of the year HS2 – the company formed by Gordon Brown to carry out the official assessment of the environmental and business case for a new high-speed line – will have reported to ministers. We at the RAC Foundation don't know what it will say, but there is no guarantee it will be a ringing endorsement of HSR at all costs. For politicians of all hues there might come a tempering of their blind faith, if not quite a Damascene conversion. Let's wait and see."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2009/sep/21/electric-cars-sustainable-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-21T14:26:11Z","webTitle":"Electric cars are driving the transition to sustainable technologies | Jeffrey Sachs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/sep/21/electric-cars-sustainable-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2009/sep/21/electric-cars-sustainable-technology","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars are driving the transition to sustainable technologies","bodyText":"The key to climate change control lies in improved technology. We need to find new ways to produce and use energy, meet our food needs, transport ourselves, and heat and cool our homes that will allow us to cut back on oil, gas, coal, nitrogen-based fertiliser, and other sources of the climate-changing greenhouse gases. There are enough good options available to suggest that the world can accomplish the goal of controlling climate change at a reasonable cost (perhaps 1% of global income per year) while enabling the world economy to continue to grow and raise living standards. One of the most exciting developments on the horizon is the new generation of electric cars. In the earliest days of the automobile in the late 19th century, many kinds of cars competed with each other – steam, battery, and internal combustion engine (ICE). The petrol- and diesel-powered internal combustion engines won the competition with the success of the Model T, which first rolled off of the assembly line in 1908. Now the age of electric vehicles is upon us. The Toyota Prius, a hybrid-electric vehicle first introduced in Japan in 1997, marked an initial breakthrough. By connecting a small generator and rechargeable battery to the braking system of a standard car, the hybrid augments the normal engine with a battery-powered motor. Petrol mileage is sufficiently enhanced to make the hybrid commercially viable, and petrol-saving vehicles will become even more commercially viable when consumers are taxed for the carbon dioxide they emit from their vehicles. Much more innovation is on the way, led by General Motors' plug-in hybrid vehicle, the Chevy Volt, at the end of 2010. While the Prius is a normal ICE automobile with a small motor, the Volt will be an electric vehicle with an engine alongside. Based on typical driving patterns, the Volt will get so many miles on the battery that it will achieve around 230 miles per gallon of petrol. Larry Burns, the visionary head of GM's research and development until his recent retirement, sees the electric vehicle as much more than an opportunity to save petrol. According to Burns, the electric-vehicle age will reshape the energy grid, redefine driving patterns, and generally improve the quality of life in urban areas, where most of the world's population will live and drive. First, there will be many types of electric vehicles, including the plug-in hybrid, the all-battery vehicle, and vehicles powered by the hydrogen fuel cell, essentially a battery fed by an external source of hydrogen. These different vehicles will be able to tap into countless energy sources. Solar, wind, or nuclear power – all free of CO2 emissions – can feed the power grid that will recharge the batteries or produce the hydrogen to power the hydrogen fuel cell. Second, the storage capacity of the vehicle fleet will play an important role in stabilising the power grid. Not only will battery-powered vehicles draw power from the electricity grid during recharging, but, when parked, they can also feed additional power back into the grid during periods of peak demand. Third, electric-powered vehicles will open up a new world of \"smart\" vehicles, in which sensor systems and vehicle-to-vehicle communications will enable collision protection, traffic routing, and remote management of the vehicle. These are visionary ideas, yet they are within technological reach. But implementing these concepts will require new forms of public-private partnership. Car-makers, utility companies, broadband providers, and government road builders will each have to contribute to an integrated system. All of these sectors will require new ways of competing and co-operating with the others. The public sector will have to put forward funding to enable the new generation of vehicles to reach commercialisation – through R&amp;D outlays, consumer subsidies, and support for complementary infrastructure (for example, outlets for recharging in public places). We need to rethink the climate challenge. By harnessing cutting-edge engineering and new kinds of public-private partnerships, we can hasten the worldwide transition to sustainable technologies, with benefits for rich and poor countries alike – and thereby find the basis for global agreements on climate change that have so far proven elusive. • Jeffrey D Sachs is professor of economics and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/mar/07/economic-recovery-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-07T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Cabinet prescribes a dose of optimism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/07/economic-recovery-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/mar/07/economic-recovery-strategy","fields":{"headline":"Cabinet prescribes a dose of optimism","bodyText":"Labour's cabinet has agreed a significant change in political strategy, based on telling voters about plans for the future of Britain instead of simply focusing on the economic crisis. Ministers want to send a message about a strategy for recovery, which Gordon Brown has described to colleagues as a \"national endeavour\", that will involve setting out fresh ideas to create jobs, develop industrial policy and re-energise public service reform, with a new set of milestones to be met within 18 months. Although the proposals stop well short of a 1970s-style National Plan, ministers believe there is a new receptiveness for an activist government. The strategy aims to inject a dose of optimism that has echoes of Barack Obama's efforts to lift the American sense of malaise. Some of the specific policy proposals have been worked out at the National Economic Council, and follow much closer working over the past six months between the skills secretary, John Denham, and the business secretary, Lord Mandelson. Denham told the Guardian: \"We need a much more active and interventionist approach to building up Britain's economic strengths in the future. You cannot just hope it is going to happen, you have to align everything government does, including in the way you invest in research, in skills and the way you invest to build the areas of the economy like low carbon, the digital economy, nuclear power. \"We need to be able to say what sort of country this is going to be.\" Denham said Labour MPs needed to start believing they can still win the next election, there is a plan for getting through the current banking problem, and the party has a view of how to create a prosperous economy in the future. \"There is a certain amount of flakiness at the moment and demoralisation because of the opinion polls. The crucial thing is rebuilding confidence and getting some backbone into people again, and saying yes, actually on the basis of this, we can win. We do believe governments can make a difference, we do think we should be organising a national effort to create a different type of economy and a different society,\" he said. Denham said: \"At the moment, someone can produce a projection where we need 30,000 skilled engineers, and it's clear we are going to get 10,000. No one necessarily steps forward to say: 'What about the other 20,000?' So we are now saying we are going to have a much more interventionist role to make sure that the gaps are filled, and not just identified.\" He said that renewable energy, nuclear power, tighter building regulation, digital infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing would provide more jobs. The remarks follow lengthy discussion inside government on how Brown may need to change gear after the G20 summit on 2 April. Addressing the Scottish Labour party yesterday, Brown again refused to accept responsibility for the UK banking crisis and the recession, insisting the banks alone were responsible. He said that banks and financial institutions needed to uphold traditional moral values of hard work and effort, enterprise and honesty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/29/us-embassy-cables-middle-east","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-29T11:50:51Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Verdict on the leaks about the Middle East | Panel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/29/us-embassy-cables-middle-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/29/us-embassy-cables-middle-east","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Verdict on the leaks about the Middle East","bodyText":"Gary Younge: 'Leaks reveal how tight room for manoeuvre can be' The behind-the-scenes revelations about American diplomacy really only shock three groups of people. The first is those who believe the US is a force for unalloyed good in the world with a foreign policy rooted in principle rather than pragmatism. Even after the past nine years the number of those in that category is higher than many would think. For them, the problem with the US invading Iraq was not that it broke international law on a false pretext, leaving thousands dead or displaced, but that it lost. The lesson they have drawn is not that the US needs to adopt more subtle methods than bombing, torturing and invading but that not all of the world is ready for freedom. Last month, during the final debate between the Colorado Senatorial candidates, Republican, Ken Buck, said: \"It's a fundamental mistake to assume that a people as backward as the Afghans are going to be able to build the industrialised nation and the democracy that it takes to be able to achieve what we would consider a western-style democracy.\" The second group is those who believe that the US can call the shots unilaterally and need not care about whatever anyone else thinks. This has long been acknowledged by the country's intelligence forces. \"Owing to the relative decline of its economic and, to a lesser extent, military power, the US will no longer have the same flexibility in choosing among as many policy options,\" concluded the National Intelligence Council (which co-ordinates analysis from all US intelligence agencies) in early 2009. The leaks reveal, among other things, just how tight the room for manoeuvre can be in the current period. They show the US attempting to trade a presidential visit to Slovenia in return for the Slovenes taking a Guantánamo prisoner and expose its inability to prevent Syrians arming Hezbollah in Lebanon. These first two may appear like straw men. But in the domestic political arena it is a bold national politician who insists that the US is anything but unrivalled in might and morality. And after the Republican victories in the mid-term elections, they will now need to be bolder still. But, finally, the third group: those on the left, who mistook American diplomacy for acts of either unalloyed evil or delusion. News of America resisting calls from the Arab world to bomb Iran simply show it is more than capable of a rational appraisal in global affairs. The diplomats in question, charged with looking after their national interests, understand that such an attack would not be in the country's interests in the region. These were probably the same diplomats who desperately tried to dissuade George Bush from invading Iraq. The state department, lest we forget, voiced internal opposition to the war and predicted many of the things that went wrong. If anything, what the leaks tell us is, in light of recent events, is that we should not confuse America's domestic politics with its diplomatic engagements; nor should we assume that its foreign and military actions are necessarily guided by its diplomatic assessments. Seumas Milne: 'Global mobilisation of US power against Iran is an ominous thread' The relentless global mobilisation of US power against Iran – and of Washington-backed Arab autocracies and dictatorships for an American attack on Tehran – is an ominous thread that runs through thousands of the leaked state department WikiLeaks cables published in the Guardian. Not only do they underline the danger represented by the threat of aggression against Iran over its nuclear programme, which of course Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes only; but the repeated private demands by the Saudi king Abdullah to \"cut off the head of the snake\" – backed up by Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain (and, of course, Israel) – also serve to drive home the utterly unrepresentative nature of the client Arab regimes that underpin western power in the Middle East. While the Arab rulers fear Iran and want the US to attack it, the majority of their people support Iran's nuclear programme and believe it would be \"positive\" for the region if Iran did develop nuclear weapons – according to the most recent poll carried out by the US Zogby polling organisation and Maryland University in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and other pro-western Arab states. Asked which countries threatened their security, 88% replied Israel, 77% the US and just 10% Iran. No doubt Saudi and Egyptian leaders will be more careful about what they say to American ambassadors in future. But then they're not the only ones. Now it's emerged from the WikiLeaks cables that Hillary Clinton has instructed US embassy staff around the world to spy on UN staff and leaders, as well as a wide range of political, business and religious figures, down to their biometric and credit card details. Plenty of others who meet US diplomats are likely to keep a closer eye on their pockets. Craig Murray: 'The best policy advice is not shielded from peer review' The securitocracy has been out in force in the media, attacking WikiLeaks and repeating their well-worn mantra: government secrecy is essential to keep us all safe. It is seriously argued that ambassadors will not in future give candid advice if there is a chance that that advice might become public. In the past 12 hours I have heard this remarkable proposition put forward on five different television networks, without anybody challenging it. I was wearily familiar with these pro-secrecy arguments in more than 20 years as a British diplomat, six of them in the senior management structure of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Put it another way and the cracks start to appear. The best advice is advice you would not be prepared to defend in public. Really? Why? In today's globalised world, embassies are not a unique source of expertise. Often, expatriate, academic and commercial organisations are a lot better informed. The best policy advice is not advice that is shielded from peer review. What the establishment mean is that ambassadors should be free to recommend things that the general public would view with deep opprobrium, without any danger of being found out. But should they really be allowed to do that, in a democracy? I have never understood why it is felt that behaviours that would be considered reprehensible in private or even commercial life – like lying, or saying one thing to one person and the opposite to another person – should be considered acceptable, or even praiseworthy, in diplomacy. When ambassador to Uzbekistan, I was rebuked by the then head of the diplomatic service for reporting to London by unclassified email the details of dreadful human rights abuses by the Uzbek government. The FCO were concerned that the Uzbeks, who were intercepting our communications, would discover that I disapproved of their human rights violations. This might endanger the Uzbek alliance with British forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. For the FCO, diplomacy is synonymous with duplicity. Among British diplomats, this belief that their profession exempts them from the normal constraints of decent behaviour amounts to a cult of Machiavellianism, a pride in their own amorality. It is reinforced by their narrow social origins – still in 2010, 80% of British ambassadors went to private schools. As a group, they view themselves as ultra-intelligent Nietzschean supermen, above normal morality. Some web commenters have noted that the released diplomatic cables reflect the US's political agenda, and there is even a wedge of the blogosphere suggesting that WikiLeaks is therefore a CIA front. This is nonsense. Of course the documents reflect the US view – they are official US government communications. What they show is something I witnessed personally, that diplomats as a class very seldom tell unpalatable truths to politicians, but rather report and reinforce what their masters want to hear, in the hope of receiving preferment. There is therefore a huge amount about Iran's putative nuclear arsenal and an exaggeration of Iran's warhead delivery capability. But there is nothing about Israel's massive nuclear arsenal. That is not because WikiLeaks has censored criticism of Israel. It is because any US diplomat who made an honest and open assessment of Israeli crimes would very quickly be an unemployed ex-diplomat. • Craig Murray is a political activist and former ambassador to Uzbekistan Richard Norton-Taylor: 'Most diplomats and spies will see the leaks as embarrassing more than anything else' An ambassador is a man of virtue sent abroad to lie for his country. To lie, but not to spy, a much more dangerous activity, as the 16th century wit who penned the well-known adage would have known only too well. The WikiLeaks cables suggest the lines between diplomacy and spying have become blurred. \"The intelligence community relies on state [department] reporting officers for much of the biographical information collected wordwide,\" says one of cables. What appears to have shocked most journalist commentators is the apparently brazen and unembarrassed request for detailed personal information, including credit card numbers and frequent flyer account numbers, of senior UN officials. Will the US ever learn? Shortly before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, a conscientious GCHQ translator, Katharine Gun, leaked a memo from the National Security Agency urging the British to help bug the phones of the UN. It caused a storm in the media. Intelligence agencies and diplomats eager for recognition demand more and more information; the question is, is it useful. The irony is that these 250,000 or so cables, subjected to varying degrees of classification (but not the highest, there are no intelligence agency cables here) were distributed to 2.5 million people because of the failure to share relevant information before the 9/11 attacks. US agencies are flooded with information as it is – what good would it really achieve getting the flyer accounts of a UN official? One test is to consider whether the information in the cables contain such information which could – or should – change US policy. Elements in the Iranian, Russian and Chinese regimes, will make use of these leaks. But in the end, most diplomats and spies will see them as simply embarrassing, hugely so but embarrassing more than anything else. The work of US diplomats will prove more difficult, perhaps for a long time to come. The real spies are likely to carry on, calmly, and hidden, as before. Juan Cole: 'The yield of the documents is actually thin' The WikiLeaks revelation that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia repeatedly urged Washington to \"cut off the head of the snake\" and launch a surgical air strike on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities sounds more sensational than it actually is. The elderly monarch risked nothing by his urgings, which put all the onus, and the possible backlash, on the United States. It is no secret that the Sunni Arab leaders in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf have been alarmed by the rise of Iran as a regional power. That rise has taken place for three reasons. First, the worrisome deterioration in the condition of stateless Palestinians under rightwing governments of Israel since 2001, and that country's increasing belligerence toward neighbours, as with the 2006 Lebanon war, have inflamed passions throughout the region, allowing Iran to position itself as a champion of the weak. Second, the Bush administration destroyed the Sunni Arabs' bulwark against Iran, the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and brought pro-Iranian Shias to power in Baghdad. Third, Iran has made progress in its nuclear enrichment program. There is no evidence that the Iranians have a nuclear weapons program, but even for Iran to possess the knowledge of how to close the fuel cycle and enrich to the level needed for a bomb would change the power equation in the Middle East. This development would give Iran the \"Japan option\" of at any time going for broke to put together a warhead. The aged Saudi monarch has been pursuing an unrealistic policy of trying to put the big blue Iranian genie back in its lantern. But note that King Abdullah has also hosted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Riyadh and has kept a dialogue going with Tehran, buttering his bread on both sides. Riyadh is not alone in its hysteria. But although Arab officials like Prince Turki al-Kabir of the Saudi foreign ministry threaten the US with a nuclear arms race if Iran gets a warhead, there is no reason to take such assertions as more than a way to put pressure on the Pentagon to do the bidding of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. If the US is wise, it will avoid being stampeded into yet another ruinous Middle Eastern war based on exaggerated fears about alleged weapons programs. Israel already has a nuclear arsenal, which is what is fuelling the current arms race in the region, and if Arab states don't care enough about Tel Aviv's nuclear weapons to seek atomic bombs themselves, it is hard to see how Iran's civilian research program could induce them to do so. Despite the breathless headlines they generated, the yield of the documents is actually thin. The most populous and militarily most important Arab state, Egypt, appears not to have been among those urging military action. There is no sign in the diplomatic cables of any practical steps toward an Arab attack on Iran, no evidence of logistical or military preparations. At most there is high-level gossip in Arab capitals that something should be done, and by someone else. In any case, if this is the anti-Iranian Arab axis, Tehran can sleep peacefully at night. • Juan Cole is the Richard P Mitchell collegiate professor of history at the University of Michigan and author of Engaging the Muslim World Abbas Edalat and Phil Wilayto: 'Iran's independent stance is hugely popular among Arabs' The latest batch of WikiLeaks revelations give the impression that it is the Arab states that are most energetically pressuring the US to attack Iran. That's definitely putting the cart before the horse. In the first place, the Arab governments mentioned as being hostile to Iran – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates – are all undemocratic, unpopular regimes that depend on US support to stay in power. As such, they seem to have absorbed the US claims that Iran is the region's greatest threat to peace. A completely different view, however, is held by these governments' own subjects, among whom Iran's independent stance is hugely popular. According to a recent poll that asked Arab people in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates to name two countries they thought were the greatest threat to the region, 88% stated Israel, 77% stated the US and only 10% mentioned Iran. Of course, no Arab country has the military capability of launching a serious attack against Iran. Only Israel has that ability in the region, but Israel is dependent for its continued existence on its $3bn in annual US subsidies and its US-supplied diplomatic firewall in the UN security council. There is almost no way Israel could attack Iran unless it had first been given a green light from Washington or because it had calculated the US would have no choice but to back it up with military force. Without a doubt, Iran does represent a threat to US imperial interests. Iran takes no orders from Washington, its natural resources are off-limits to Western corporations and it has no love for the corrupt, pro-Western governments that dominate the region. As such, it represents an obstacle to US hegemony. To demonise Iran, the US has for eight years promoted the myth of an Iranian nuclear weapons programme, much as it demonised Iraq through its false charges about weapons of mass destruction. And while this myth has formed the basis for four sets of UN sanctions against Iran, the US has never provided the first shred of proof and its \"evidence\" of Iran's nuclear weapons studies has now been shown to be simply a fabrication. No, the principal threat to Iran remains the United States, which for years, prodded by nuclear-armed Israel, has declared that \"all options are on the table.\" On 5 December, Iran is scheduled to begin revived negotiations with the five permanent UN security council members, plus Germany. This would be an ideal time for Washington to make the following declaration: that it will not attack Iran, will not allow an attack by Israel, will end all sanctions against Iran, will recognise Iran's right under the UN's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to pursue peaceful nuclear power, will return Iran's nuclear file from the UN Security Council to the IAEA in exchange for Iran's stated pledge to allow the intrusive inspections of the IAEA's Additional Protocol and will agree to discuss all outstanding differences in a spirit of mutual respect. • Abbas Edalat is founder of the Campaign Against Sanctions &amp; Military Intervention in Iran.

A day after Barack Obama scrapped plans to deploy missile defence technology in eastern Europe, the Associated Press said it had obtained material from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which suggests that it was more convinced Iran had been trying to make a bomb than its outgoing director, Mohamed ElBaradei, had admitted. \"The agency … assesses that Iran has sufficient information to be able to design and produce a workable implosion nuclear device based on HEU [highly enriched uranium] as the fission fuel,\" AP quoted a \"secret annexe\" to a report on Iran as saying. Western diplomats confirmed that the annexe was authentic. \"Its absolutely accurate,\" one official said. \"It shows the agency's thinking, which is that Iran is a lot further along on this than most people think. It suggests the Iranians have done a lot of work.\" The annexe said Iranian scientists had engaged in \"probable testing\" of explosives arranged in a hemisphere, which is how an implosion-type nuclear warhead is triggered. There was also evidence, the report says, that Iran had worked on developing a chamber to carry a warhead on top of one of its missiles \"that is quite likely to be nuclear\". Attention will now focus on the United Nations in New York next week, where Obama takes the rare step of chairing a security council session in order to generate momentum towards nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and consensus over Iran. His decision to change tack on missile defence has raised the prospect of improved co-operation with Russia in the security council. The Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, has praised Obama's U-turn as \"correct and bold\". In a second overture to the Russians today, the Nato military alliance proposed a joint missile defence system to counter the danger of rocket attacks from countries like Iran. \"Our nations, and our forces deployed in theatre, will all become increasingly vulnerable to missile attacks by third parties,\" said Nato's new secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in a speech made in Brussels. \"We should explore the potential for linking the US, Nato and Russia missile defence systems at an appropriate time … Both Nato and Russia have a wealth of experience in missile defence. We should now work to combine this experience to our mutual benefit.\" Along with China, Russia has hitherto proved reluctant to support calls from the US and its western allies to deter Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons through heavier sanctions. Moscow has indicated that it will not necessarily reverse its course as a result of the US climbdown on missile defence, but it equally has no interest in another nuclear power emerging on its southern fringe. The IAEA annexe, entitled Possible Military Dimension of Iran's Nuclear Program, gives details of a top-level meeting in 1984 in which Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, then president and now supreme leader, appears to give the green light for building a bomb, saying: \"A nuclear arsenal would serve Iran as a deterrent in the hands of God's soldiers.\" Intelligence agencies in the US, Britain, France and Germany all believe that Iran has worked on developing a nuclear warhead, but they differ on how long that work went on and whether it is still continuing. A US national intelligence estimate two years ago said that development work on a warhead ended in 2003, although British officials have questioned this assessment. The AP report does not make it clear when or whether the IAEA inspectors believe that warhead work is finished. Separately, North Korea indicated todaythat it was willing to engage in multilateral talks in an announcement that could pave the way for the reopening of disarmament negotiations. \"North Korea would like to solve relevant issues through bilateral and multilateral talks,\" leader Kim Jong-il told Chinese president Hu Jintao's special envoy, according to a report by China's official Xinhua news agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/oct/09/ofgem-warns-energy-prices-could-surge","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-09T16:18:00Z","webTitle":"Ofgem calls for £200bn investment to meet UK energy targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/09/ofgem-warns-energy-prices-could-surge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/oct/09/ofgem-warns-energy-prices-could-surge","fields":{"headline":"Energy firms must invest £200bn to meet UK targets, says regulator","bodyText":"The energy regulator has warned that £200bn of new investment may be needed in the next few years in a tacit admission that the deregulated private sector industry is failing to deliver energy security and meet climate change plans for Britain. Consumers could face price rises of up to 60% in their gas and electricity bills in the next seven years as energy supplies become more volatile, admitted Ofgem. The regulator has previously championed a low-cost market. The unwillingness of energy companies to invest in Britain was underlined this week when German-owned utility E.ON postponed a plan to build a new \"clean\" coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent. The recession and the difficulties of obtaining funding, plus uncertainties over government energy policies, have led some other companies to delay their plans for renewables or concentrate on building relatively cheap gas-fired plants. But an Ofgem report said the biggest challenge was the country's growing reliance on a volatile global gas market as North Sea supplies dwindled and the need rose for variable power to compensate for intermittent sources such as wind. \"Our scenarios suggest that Britain faces a tough challenge in maintaining secure supplies whilst at the same time meeting its climate change targets ... Early action can avoid hasty and expensive measures later,\" said Ofgem chief executive, Alistair Buchanan. Too little, too late Energy analyst David Hunter at McKinnon &amp; Clarke welcomed the Ofgem review but said it was a decade too late. \"Lack of clear direction from the government has not given privately owned energy companies confidence in investing in the UK's energy market. This has led to ageing power stations not being replaced, a lacklustre approach to developing new technologies such as carbon capture and clean coal, and poor gas storage facilities.\" The accountant Ernst &amp; Young said the deregulated and competitive market had left companies making commercial decisions that suited their own interests but not necessarily those of the country. The energy sector has been delivering investment of £6bn to £7bn of every year, but this is half the amount necessary by 2020 under the £200bn target used by Ofgem. \"That [£200bn] figure is going to be a stretch,\" said Duncan Coneybeare, utility analyst at Ernst &amp; Young. Shadow energy secretary Greg Clark said the challenges in the energy sector came about because of government \"dithering\". \"There has been no policy, effectively,\" he said. \"We are in the situation we are because they have had their head in the sand for 12 years.\" Clark said a Conservative government would take immediate action to authorise 5GW of capacity in clean coal and publish planning guidance for companies wishing to invest in nuclear power. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said the report by the energy regulator was just a timely review of what might be needed in future. \"Ofgem is examining a range of hypothetical scenarios. It's prudent to do so, however unlikely they are. What's clear, and set out in our transition plan, is that there's no low-cost, high-carbon future. It's critical we maximise the effect of our planning reforms, clean energy rewards and efficiency measures to shift us away from fossil fuels and into a low-carbon mix,\" said a spokesman. Gas dependence is predicted by the regulator to increase \"dramatically\", leading to risks if supplies are disrupted through a severe winter. Ofgem said that while the outlook for the coming Christmas period is \"more comfortable\" – with National Grid anticipating high capacity and good gas infrastructure – its analysis suggests \"existing regulatory and market arrangements may well be tested severely over the next two decades\". The report outlines its provisional assessment of supply issues. Ofgem is due to make further recommendations at the end of the year. Market failure But energy industry experts see the report as an acceptance that the market-driven system has failed and the government needs to be more interventionist. The Which? consumer group said the Ofgem licensing agreements should force energy companies to build new gas storage facilities and other plants. \"If the market isn't delivering the necessary investment, the government needs to act to ensure the lights won't go off and consumers aren't left to pick up the tab,\" it added. The EEF manufacturing organisation said the Ofgem report raised questions about relying on a \"dogmatic\" approach to renewables targets, indicating these should be scaled down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2009/jan/11/3","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-11T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Pendennis: The Observer diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/jan/11/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2009/jan/11/3","fields":{"headline":"Pendennis: The Observer diary","bodyText":"Andrew courts nuclear meltdown at the Palace What is Prince Andrew's new year's resolution? Not, it seems, to be any less controversial than he was in 2008. This column has learnt of a plan to hold a gala lunch on 5 February at Buckingham Palace for heavy hitters in the nuclear industry, which is, according to critics, a startlingly fraught arena for a member of the royal family to enter. The lunch is to be hosted by the prince as the UK's special representative for international trade and investment, the idea of the job being that he can use his royal clout to promote Britain abroad, although providing a publicity boost for nuclear energy within the UK is a departure. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament is writing to him. Kate Hudson, chair of CND, says: \"It's outrageous that Prince Andrew and the Palace are being used to promote nuclear power. This has always been a contentious political issue and is likely to become more as the government's plans move forward. When this is an issue that divides MPs and the country, it is thoroughly wrong for it to appear that the royal family supports nuclear power. This event should be cancelled.\" Further criticism comes from other anti-nuclear campaigners contacted by this column last week. Jim Duffy of the Stop Hinkley group says he is \"furious\", while Peter Roche of No 2 Nuclear Power points out that several mainstream political parties (the Lib Dems and the SNP, for example) are opposed to any expansion of nuclear power and that the royals should \"remain aloof\". So far, there's no word from Prince Charles about the lunch, but his recently appointed deputy private secretary may not be best pleased. Benet Northcote joined the royal household from Greenpeace, where he was a doughty campaigner against nuclear energy. Oh how sweet - kitchen confidential with Sam Cam Good to learn from a five-page portrait in February's Vogue that Dave Cameron's wife Samantha is \"not a 'no carbs' sort of person. She prepares food with a glass of wine in one hand and plenty of chat\". It can't have been difficult for writer Lisa Armstrong to procure access, as the mag's deputy editor is Emily Sheffield, Sam Cam's sister. The Tories can look forward to less desirable publicity from another style magazine, however. I'm told Harpers is compiling an article on the jeunesse dorée of the 1980s, featuring snaps of organisations such as the Bullingdon Club: \"It might include a number of faces now familiar from the Tory frontbench\". Marr's star-gazing takes centre stage Renaissance man Andrew Marr has made his acting debut. At the request of director Kevin Spacey, he has recorded clips shown during the stage show Complicit at the Old Vic. \"It's an American play about the extent to which journalists can and should be held accountable,\" he tells me. Marr's part consists of interviewing Richard Drefuss, who plays a celebrity journo in the play, as though he were a guest on Marr's Sunday morning chatshow. \"It was harder than doing a real interview; you have to concentrate on what you're supposed to be saying, not what you're thinking.\" Prophet motive takes a panning in name calling Where have all the Muhammads gone? When the annual lists of the UK's most popular names were produced in 2007, it was reported Muhammad (plus variants) was in second place and due to come first in 2008. When the lists were published last month, it was nowhere to be seen. Jack was still top with Oliver (I'm pleased to note) second. The Office for National Statistics tells me it has decided not to produce a definitive list any more, so those published recently have been taken from other sources. \"They've always been compiled from the NHS register, control of which was last year handed over to the Information Centre for Health and Social Care, so we don't have access,\" I'm told. \"There are other data sources, but they'd take a lot of time to sort out, so we've stopped.\" Bitching Hitchens A resumption of hostilities in the battle of the Hitchens brothers.

Peter (practising Anglican; didn't go to Oxford) has just signed a contract to write a volume of his own about God, to be published by Continuum in September. Friends suggest it is - in part - an attack on his brother: \"Peter is determined his book should be published before Christopher's memoir.\" Blair's bum note Those who don't think Tony Blair is the best person to sort out the Middle East will be relieved to hear the Quartet representative was otherwise engaged for some of Thursday night as a guest on the French chatshow Le Grand Journal, discussing the Queen's dress sense.

The trade and industry secretary, Alistair Darling, said he would \"take on board\" today's court ruling, which found that the review process used to decide whether to support the construction of new plants was \"very seriously flawed\" and \"procedurally unfair\". Mr Darling said: \"I will ensure we now do a proper consultation ... It is important that we do reach a view on what the future should be.\" A Department of Trade and Industry spokesman said the judgment was about the process of consultation, not the principle of nuclear power. The department said a decision needed to be taken by the end of the year on whether to build nuclear power stations. \"We continue to believe nuclear power has a role to play in cutting emissions and helping to give this country the energy security it needs,\" the department said in a statement. \"This is why we will press on with publication of the energy white paper and why we are confident in the strength of our arguments to engage in further consultation.\" At the high court earlier today, Mr Justice Sullivan granted the environmental group Greenpeace an order quashing the government's decision to build new nuclear power stations. Greenpeace had accused the government of reneging on its promise to carry out \"the fullest consultation\" before making its decision. It said the government failed to present clear proposals and information on key issues surrounding a new generation of nuclear plants, such as the disposal of radioactive waste and the financial costs of building new plants. Mr Justice Sullivan said the consultation document gave every appearance of being simply an \"issues paper\". It contained no actual proposals and, even if it had, the information given to consultees was \"wholly insufficient for them to make an intelligent response\". The information given on waste was \"not merely inadequate but also misleading\". Sarah North, the head of Greenpeace's nuclear campaign, said: \"The government's so-called consultation on nuclear power was obviously a sham, and we're pleased that the judge has agreed with us ... They've now been forced back to the drawing board to conduct a proper and lengthy review.\" Peter Luff, the chairman of the Commons trade and industry select committee, described Greenpeace's success as a \"a hollow victory\". The Conservative MP said the government had been rushing the consultation to make up for lost time, but he insisted nuclear power was still necessary to secure future energy supplies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/15/low-carbon-transition-white-paper","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-15T20:55:39Z","webTitle":"Dawn of a renewable energy era as government unveils climate plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/15/low-carbon-transition-white-paper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/15/low-carbon-transition-white-paper","fields":{"headline":"Dawn of a renewable energy era as government unveils climate plans","bodyText":"The government today outlined an energy revolution aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 34% within only 11 years and set the nation on track for an 80% cut by 2050. It signalled a historic switch away from fossil fuels, which drove the industrial revolution for 200 years, towards a future economy that will depend on renewable and nuclear power. Ministers hope the blizzard of measures and targets, intended to rapidly cut energy use across electricity generation, homes, transport and industry, will put Britain in pole position among rich countries grappling to tackle climate change ahead of new international agreements. The Low Carbon Transition Plan pledged: • 40% of electricity to come from low carbon sources, including new nuclear power by 2020. • £3.2bn to be invested by energy companies to improve the poor energy efficiency in UK homes. • Smart electricity meters in every home by 2020. • Support for ultra-low carbon cars. • Cash for households that generate their own energy. • 400,000 green jobs. The white paper, which is expected to become law by the end of the year, was welcomed by environmental and business groups as an ambitious model for other countries. But it was criticised by others for falling short of the cuts scientists are demanding, ducking the controversial issue of coal burning and being almost impossible to achieve in such a short time. Deborah Doane, director of the World Development Movement, added: \"Worryingly, the government has said it can use carbon offsetting [abroad] to meet targets if we fail to cut emissions. \"This is a dangerous get-out-of-jail-free card, which could be disastrous for the climate and for the world's poorest people. The government has to be completely committed to reducing our emissions here in the UK.\" All sectors of government have been allocated a carbon budget that will force them to reduce emissions in their areas. The energy industry will make the biggest cuts, reducing emissions by more than 20% by 2020, transport by 10% and the military by 5%. Each government department will have to come up with detailed plans for cuts in the next few months. \"The budgets are expected to be met through a commitment in law to get 15% of all our energy from renewable sources by 2020,\" said Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary. \"Every business and community will need to be involved. The scale of the task is enormous.\" At the heart of the government's plans are giant offshore wind parks. The renewable energy industry will be given £120m to develop offshore wind technologies and £60m will go to marine energy. In addition, new planning laws now in place should make it much easier to build onshore wind farms, and all new coal power stations will have to be equipped with some degree of carbon capture and storage by 2020. Deep cuts – 29% by 2020 – are expected to come from households, which currently emit more than one third of UK emissions. Energy companies will invest £3.2bn in the next four years to enable 7.5m households to save energy with insulation and other devices. In addition, all homes will be equipped with a \"smart\" electricity meter by 2020 and every new home will have to meet stringent new building regulations. Further grants, said the white paper, will be made available via a \"pay-as-you-save\" scheme for homeowners to receive loans to insulate their homes. With money repaid by savings in energy costs pilot schemes will be launched next year. But the paper said the transition to a low-carbon economy would cost many billions of pounds in the next 12 years, a figure the government has to compare with expected oil and gas price rises. The average household could expect an 8% increase in energy prices over the next 11 years, said the paper, though this estimate relied on consumers using less energy, said Miliband. The government expects business to profit from the transition to a low-carbon economy, citing \"huge opportunities for UK business to take part in the global £3tn low-carbon market that will employ more than one million people in the UK by 2015.\" The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, said the proposals would be important for the economic recovery, adding: \"The government is determined to ensure it maximises the economic and employment opportunities this transition offers.\" John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: \"If this plan becomes a reality, it will create hundreds of thousands of green jobs and make Britain a more prosperous country. This will be good for the British economy and, in the long-run, save householders money.\" The competition from other nations for low-carbon business was highlighted by Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society. He said: \"Decarbonising electricity and transport and increasing energy efficiency are essential. \"The UK can derive great benefit from taking a lead in innovative science and technology. Indeed, further increases will be necessary if we are to respond fittingly to developments in the US.\" But Greg Clark, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: \"The government must decide whether it breaks with the past and implements the policies we all know are needed, or whether the next 12 months will prove, like the last 12 years, to have been a time of opportunity lost. Tim Yeo, Tory chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, added that the scale of action still did not match the challenge.

The two-seater electric car parked in the street outside has been bought with a £5,000 discount from the government and the car is exempt from the £50 daily congestion charge across Greater London. As the capital was chosen a decade ago as a \"core electric vehicle city\", charging stations for the car are ubiquitous. The flat dweller continues to take two flights a year for holidays in the sun, because the cost of air travel has not risen in real terms for 10 years, meaning aviation comprises a large portion of the UK carbon budget. Two-child family, living in detached house near Manchester with a high income Despite working in one of the new \"green industries\" completing the installation of smart meters, the family breadwinner has mixed feelings about the last 10 years. The family has a draughty 19th century house and heating and electricity bills have soared, partly because of the Russian gas supply crisis of 2015 and partly because of the contributions paying for thousands of new offshore wind turbines. Being high earners the family has been not eligible for subsidised loft and wall insulation. Their transport costs have also increased, as rail fares have risen about 7% a year, helping to fund the new high-speed network and electrification programme. The family has organised a site visit from a solar company to cost the installation of solar photovoltaic panels. A friend who already has solar PV says the government's Clean Energy Cashback department \"sends me a cheque for hundreds of pounds every year\".

On the morning of Sunday 7 January 2007, one of the contractors working on decommissioning the Sizewell A nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast was in the laundry room when he noticed cooling water leaking on to the floor from the pond that holds the reactor's highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. As much as 40,000 gallons of radioactive water spilled out of a 15ft long split in a pipe, some leaking into the North Sea. The pond water level had dropped by more than a foot (330mm) – yet none of the sophisticated alarms in the plant sounded in the main control room. By the time of the next scheduled safety patrol, the pond level would have dipped far enough to expose the nuclear fuel rods – potentially causing them to overheat and catch fire sending a plume of radioactive contamination along the coastline. The HM Nuclear Installation Inspectorate's report of the incident, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, said: \"The pond could have been drained (it takes about 10 hours) before the required plant tour by an operator had taken place. In this worst-case scenario, if the exposed irradiated fuel caught fire it would result in an airborne off-site release.\" It concluded: \"NII believes that there was significant risk that operators and even members of the public could have been harmed if there had not been fortunate and appropriate intervention of a contractor who just happened to be in the right plant area when things went wrong.\" But the NII said the operator Magnox Electric responded quickly once the leak had been discovered. It said: \"The only good action noted was that when the contractor raised the alarm the operators appeared to react very well and avoided a significant event from becoming a very serious off-site event.\" The NII report was obtained by the independent nuclear consultant John Large as part of a dossier he compiled for the local Shutdown Sizewell Campaign. The owners, now Magnox South, say it had little effect on the environment and represented a fraction of the site's annual discharge limit. Magnox South said it took the incident extremely seriously and co-operated fully with both the NII and the Environment Agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/16/renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-16T14:13:25Z","webTitle":"Q&A: Renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/16/renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/16/renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: Renewable energy","bodyText":"What is renewable energy? Anything that can be used to make heat or electricity without unsustainable fuels and which does not make a net contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This includes wind power, waves and the tides, solar energy, geothermal energy and biomass. Nuclear power, although it is low-carbon, cannot be counted as a renewable source of energy because its fuel, uranium, is finite. What are the UK's commitments on renewables? The UK is committed to producing 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 — this is equivalent to around 35% of its electricity. What are the leading technologies? The UK has huge resources in wind and wave power and, in the first of these, has done relatively well to ramp up development and installation. By 2007, there were 2GW of turbines installed. The British Wind Energy Association (BWEA) says 9GW of offshore wind will be in place by 2015, overtaking installed nuclear power. This month, Centrica and RWE npower came close to approving two offshore wind farms costing an estimated £3bn. According to the Centre for Alternative Technology, wave power could supply 10% of the UK's energy needs but this technology is at a much earlier stage. Although there are scores of British designs for wave energy converters, none are anywhere near commercial scale. The biggest tidal project on the cards is at the mouth of the Severn river. This has the second highest tidal range in the world, and the government is consulting on a range of projects that could harness the energy. The plans preferred by the government, which include a large 10-mile barrage across the river, have dismayed many environmentalists. Bristol-based group Stop the Barrage Now say that the largest barrage would add to local flooding, reduce fish stocks, damage bird life and destroy the Severn bore, the tidal wave that flows up the river. They also argue the development will ruin mudflats across an area of more than 77 square miles. Many green groups favour tidal lagoons, which have lower impact but are unproven technologies. These artificial lagoons flood as the tides rise and then trap water as the tide falls. The water then passes through a hydropower turbine to generate electricity. Solar technologies include photovoltaics or PV, where sunlight is used to create electricity directly and solar thermal, which can be used in small set-ups to heat water for homes. Concentrating solar power plants focus sunlight from hundreds of mirrors onto a central tower, where water is superheated into steam that can turn turbines and make electricity. Geothermal energy involves tapping the heat stored underground - traditional methods harnesses naturally occurring pockets of steam or hot water that rise from deep underground, bringing with them the energy stored by the rocks there. Enhanced methods allow those traditional techniques to be applied almost anywhere by drilling deep into the Earth and pumping water into the hole, the underground hot rocks fracture, allowing the water to circulate and be heated. What is the progress globally? The UK still only gets 1.8% of its energy from renewables, according to government figures. EU figures for 2005 show that, in Sweden, the renewable share was upwards of 40% and Finland's was around 30%. Denmark got more than 20% of its electricity-generating capacity from wind power thanks to consistent support ion the technology from the government. Germany gets 5.9% of its energy from renewables, largely thanks to a feed-in tariff for solar energy, which pays consumers a premium rate for any electricity they feed into the national grid. According to the Renewable Energy Policy Network (REPN), global power capacity from new renewable energy sources (excluding large hydro) reached 280,000 MW in 2008 – a 16% rise from the 240,000MW in 2007. Green energy investment overtook fossil fuels in attracting investment for first time last year, according to the United Nations. Wind, solar and other clean technologies attracted $140bn (£85bn) compared with $110bn for gas and coal for electrical power generation, with more than a third of the money destined for Britain and the rest of Europe. The biggest growth was in China, India and other developing countries. What is the UK's problem? Some people blame the market, others argue that the government has not been bold enough in tangible, long-term support for renewables industries. Since the 1980s, the government has been keen not to pick winners in technology terms and has created non-specific incentives such as the renewable obligations certificates (ROCs) to encourage renewable technologies. The problem is that this has only encouraged low-risk renewables such as onshore wind. What plans are there for the future? The REPN says that, as of 2009, at least 73 countries have renewable energy policy targets and, in response to the financial crisis, many governments are spending their economic stimulus funding towards new green jobs the renewable energy sector can provide. In the US, part of the economic stimulus package will invest $150bn over 10 years in renewable energy. South Korea has ear-marked 81% of its stimulus package worth £23bn to green measures. China is planning a big increase in its use of wind and solar power in the next decade — officials there believe it could match Europe by 2020, producing a fifth of its energy needs from renewable sources. In the current development plan, the goal for wind energy is 30GW but the government is thinking about increasing this goal to 100GW by 2020. In the US, the Waxman-Markey bill recently proposed a tentative agreement to create a renewable power target of 15% by 2020. The UN believes $750bn needs to be spent worldwide between 2009 and 2011 although the current year has started with a 53% slump in first quarter renewables investment to $13.3bn. What are the commercial opportunities? The government reckons that the low-carbon environmental goods and services sector was worth £3,046bn in 2007/8. Asia accounted for 38% of this total, Europe 27%, and the Americas 30%. In the UK, this sector was valued at £106.5bn, making it the world's sixth largest low-carbon and environmental economy, with 3.5% of global market share. The report went on to forecast up to an additional 400,000 jobs over the next eight years, many of these in the renewable energy and new low-carbon industries. Just taking these sectors alone, the market value of low-carbon technology and services could be £127bn in 2014/15, employing 1.04 million people. According to the Carbon Trust, the UK could benefit from 250,000 jobs and up to £70bn in revenue from offshore wind and wave technologies by 2050. But this potential will only be realised if the government gives clear signals to industry, so that investors know where to put their money, rather than leaving new technologies to face the market alone. It would need investment of up to £600m into research, the removal of regulatory barriers and incentives to increase the deployment of the turbines. In the UK this means installing around 29GW of wind by 2020 and upwards of 40GW by 2050. A large part of the economic benefit would come from exporting technology developed here. For wave, the outlook is more modest. Around a quarter of the world's wave technologies are being developed in the UK and the Carbon Trust said Britain should be the \"natural owner\" of the global market in this area. It could generate revenues worth £2bn a year by 2050 and up to 16,000 direct jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/sep/15/ken-clarke-philip-hammond","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-14T23:15:00Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/15/ken-clarke-philip-hammond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/sep/15/ken-clarke-philip-hammond","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"Ever get the impression that Ken Clarke, the shadow business secretary, doesn't spend much time chewing the fat with his colleagues? Yesterday on the Today programme he bemoaned the cost of the Independent Safeguarding Authority, the under-fire quango that will vet adults who have significant contact with children. \"But you're not going to close it down,\" countered Justin Webb. \"Are we not?\" inquired Ken. And he warned us all about Philip Holland, who will lead the Tory assault on out-of-control spending across government departments. But it's Hammond, Ken, Philip Hammond, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Philip Holland was a fellow Tory MP in the East Midlands, the scourge of quangos in the 70s. And the leader now, he's called Cameron. Write it down. Yes, the Tories are coming and there will be no room for slackers. No room for officials seen to have been anything less than efficient. And thus, we fear, no room for the smart types responsible for the National Blood Service ad which appeared on the gay dating website Gaydar, seeking donations. Sexually active gay and bisexual men are specifically banned as blood donors by the NBS itself. The ban is highly controversial – many believe it shouldn't exist at all – but there was a foul-up, we are informed, involving Yahoo, which meant the strict rules were not adhered to. The ads went up but were quickly taken down again in the hope that no one noticed. We noticed. We would. Long hours, the relentless pressure, the hothouse that is daily broadcasting. Strange things happen on Newsnight. They work hard, play hard, and it shows. \"There remain the white cotton knickers. If anyone finds they're missing a pair, they're hanging on the coat-stand in my office,\" wrote Paxman in a wistful email to colleagues yesterday. If anyone claims them, we'll let you know. Things grow increasingly poisonous within Labour ranks. And reports that John Hutton, the former minister behind a £12.5bn nuclear power deal with energy giant EDF, is discussing a nice new job with the firm, won't help. Perpetually cross backbencher Paul Flynn is first to get stuck in. \"On many occasions I have criticised former minister John Hutton. I have never seen the point of him. The answers he has given to all the questions I have asked him prove that he is stupid. Now there are allegations that he is greedy,\" blogs Flynn. He isn't finished. \"I have criticised John Hutton as a shallow politician who has never been accused of having an original thought. He even started to imitate the way that Tony Blair speaks.\" The ultimate insult, nowadays. No flesh wounds accepted. It's all shoot to kill. And daily there are signs that Mandy is the government and the government is Mandy. The \"glossiest coat\", the \"sharpest claws\" was the verdict of Public Servant magazine last week. \"The one high peak in a fairly low mountain range,\" declared headhunter Peter Waine yesterday in the FT, amid much talk of how Mandelson is propping them all up and will make a mint when it's all over. Luckily, he takes this stuff in his stride. Not the least bit arrogant. Finally, Mayor Boris said we should fast for a day to learn more about Islam. But what about Judaism? Shouldn't non-Jews seek to connect with that great religion, too? The Jewish Chronicle asked his communications supremo Guto Harri. \"Mr Harri explained that Mr Johnson believed that it might be easier for non-Jews and non-Muslims to fast on Ramadan than on Yom Kippur, because there were so many more days of the Muslim festival from which to choose,\" said the Chronicle. \"Any parallel between the two festivals was 'not close enough to be relevant'. However, Mr Harri said, if a non-Jew were to ask their Jewish friend how they could learn more about Yom Kippur and it was suggested that they fast, then 'by implication' the mayor would support such a move.\" We're skipping breakfast until it all becomes clear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/sep/13/greenland-oil-environment-arctic-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-13T06:59:30Z","webTitle":"The Arctic oil rush","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/13/greenland-oil-environment-arctic-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/sep/13/greenland-oil-environment-arctic-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"The Arctic oil rush","bodyText":"The fight was over almost before it began. A short, middle-aged woman had smashed her fist into the face of another female drinker, and within seconds was dragged to the door by a hulking bouncer and flung on to the streets of Nuuk. It was midnight on a Tuesday but the atmosphere in the Kristinemut bar resembled a hardcore weekend: raucous band, chaotic dancing, and more than a handful of revellers (of all ages) best described as \"blotto\". Not everyone in the bar may have realised it, but these residents of Greenland's capital had good reason to celebrate. That morning, local television reported that traces of gas had been discovered by the British exploration company Cairn Energy in Baffin Bay a few hundred miles to the north-west. If these first hydrocarbon traces prove an accurate indicator of major reserves below the Arctic seabed, they may in time produce untold wealth for Greenland's population – financially dependent on Denmark – of 56,000 Inuit and other ethnic groups, clinging to existence 460 miles from the North Pole in one of the world's harshest terrains. The bulk of this huge land is a vast – and breathtakingly beautiful – white desert. A layer of ice, 3km thick, covers 80% of the country for 12 months of the year. Even along the coastline, where the population is huddled, the black rock of the precipitous mountains and brown vegetation are only visible during the summer months. With virtually no trees and a winter temperature that can sink as low as -70C, the name Greenland is misleading – deliberately so, in fact. It was an early \"marketing tool\" used by Erik the Red in 982, as he tried to lure fellow Vikings from warmer climes to settle here, having failed to sell a similar message about Iceland. These days the terrain is even bleaker (where once pigs and cattle roamed in the south of the country, now there are polar bears, seals and walruses), but this frozen and largely unexplored land will not deter today's prospectors, tempted by the possibility of an Arctic \"oil rush\". The kind of oil and gas reserves believed to reside in the wider Arctic region could be worth as much as $7tn, which is why all the big oil companies are queueing up to woo the Greenland government into granting them exploration licences. Ever since the days of John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil, the oil industry has thrived on breaking open new energy frontiers – and there is no greater challenge than the Arctic, particularly in the wake of BP's Gulf of Mexico nightmare. Environmentalists, of course, regard the exploitation of one of the last remaining areas of pristine wilderness on the planet with horror, and up in Baffin Bay, there has been an ongoing physical confrontation between a Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, and the Danish navy as it defends the Cairn Energy rig from marauding protesters. The setting could not be more symbolic: around them, glaciers and icebergs melt as a direct result of global warming, a phenomenon that will only be exacerbated should the Arctic be allowed to give up its oil and gas reserves. Inside the Kristinemut bar, Nive Nielsen, a local singer with a growing international reputation, is decidedly sober about the implications of any major oil find in Greenland. \"I guess what I would like to see is the government tread very carefully. I am worried they are rushing ahead too quickly [with oil licensing],\" she says. \"Most people here – possibly 80% – think this drilling can only be good for Greenland, but we have already seen the traditional ways of doing things being eroded, and people herded into [modern town-housing] blocks.\" Kenni Rende, a 44-year-old shop assistant at the Nota Bene electronics shop, is more positive about the prospect. \"We have always believed there was oil and gas off this island; we've been waiting for something like this to happen for decades. I hope it will provide income for Greenland, so we can finance our way to becoming a more independent nation.\" His upbeat mood is, not surprisingly, shared at the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum a few blocks away, where Henrik Stendal has been digesting the news of the Cairn find in a presentation room packed with rock samples and geological maps. \"It is exciting . . . This amounts to an appetiser for all oil companies to come here and do more exploration,\" says Stendal, who is head of the bureau's geology department. The affable rocks specialist claims not to have known about Cairn's find until the company announced it on 24 August with a simple statement: \"First hydrocarbons discovered in Baffin Bay basin by T8-1 well, which has encountered gas.\" The release of drilling information is always sensitive. It can send a company's share price soaring and act as a magnet for competitors. As a result, relations between small government and Big Oil are complex. The Greenland government is keen to keep the discovery's momentum going and attract new investment; but it is also anxious not to upset Cairn and its City investors by speaking out of turn (when the Guardian quoted a foreign ministry official as saying he was \"hopeful\" of a positive drilling result the day before Cairn announced it, a government public relations adviser was quickly in touch to admonish me). Cairn Energy's founder and chief executive officer is Sir Bill Gammell, a former Scottish rugby international and public-school friend of Tony Blair. His Edinburgh-based company, while not in the Shell or BP league in scale, likes to work in frontier areas and has already attracted a stream of loyal investors after striking oil in the Indian state of Rajasthan, on acreage sold to it for a song by an unusually slipshod Shell. Speaking about Cairn's Arctic find, Gammell said he was \"encouraged that we have early indications of a working hydrocarbon system with our first well in Greenland, confirming our belief in the exploration potential\". Yet even such tentative enthusiasm was dampened by one worker on the rig who, asking to remain anonymous, told the Guardian that there had been laughter aboard Cairn's Stena Don drilling unit when newspapers and television began to report the discovery. \"We thought the media had made it up until we saw the company's statements,\" said the rig worker, adding that the quantity found was little more than you might find if you drilled a hole in your back garden. Cairn has dismissed this version of events and most industry commentators do not take it seriously. Tellingly, it is not what the majority of Greenland's politicians and public want to hear either, determined as they are to loosen their sovereign ties with Denmark and, ultimately, establish independence. At around four times the size of Britain, Greenland is the least densely populated country in the world, and desperately dependent on fishing, a small amount of tourism, and one working gold mine. The national books are balanced courtesy of a DKK3bn (£333m) annual handout from the Danish taxpayer. While the hunting of seals and other local animals is still practised by a handful of Greenlanders, the bulk of the population finds work in the public sector – in schools, hospitals or administration. But all that would change if the oil industry moved in. The town of Nuuk is a strange mixture of attractive clapboard houses painted in bright colours typical of the Nordic region, and drab apartment blocks with graffitied stairwells that might look more at home in the former Soviet Union. Mineral extraction – be it oil or gas, gold or diamonds – is seen as a huge opportunity by the residents here. Already, crude oil has been found leaking out of the rocks in the Disko Bay area, and offshore, Greenland's west coast is believed to possess the same basic rock formations as those on the Canadian east coast, where massive oil finds have already been made. According to a 2009 US Geological survey, there could be 90bn barrels of oil – a third of the size of Saudi Arabia's reserves – and 5otn cubic metres of gas in the wider Arctic region. Tentative drilling has already been happening all the way from the Chukotka Sea off Alaska to the Faroe Islands north of Scotland, although some has been halted while safety agencies reconsider the risks in the light of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Few regions, though, have been pushing as hard to attract Big Oil as Greenland. As early as this week, its government may announce the winners of new exploration licenses, with many of the big names including Shell and Statoil of Norway – but not BP – expected to begin frontier-drilling here for the first time. With the continued rise in global commodity prices, this could yet turn into a fully fledged oil rush. And, while the Cairn gas discovery has centred attention on hydrocarbons, there is a parallel drive to uncover all sorts of precious metals including diamonds, rubies and other rare earth products. This autumn, the Greenland government will decide whether uranium for nuclear power stations could also be mined here. Dennis Thomas, a veteran British mining prospector, is currently making his first visit to Greenland in more than 40 years, as he scouts the world for new projects. \"I have seen gold prospects, iron, copper, rare earths,\" he says. \"It's all very early stage, but the time is right in terms of the economics and the willingness of the government [to open up].\" But it is not going to be easy. While global commodity prices have boomed over the last decade due to demand from countries such as China, Greenland remains a high-cost place to mine, not least because of the treacherous weather conditions. \"You have to bring in everything by helicopter and you might have only a three-month season to do the work,\" Thomas says. But the prospector, who lives near Yeovil in Somerset but works for financial and mining investors around the world, still describes Greenland as an \"exciting\" prospect. As for the islanders themselves, they are very focused on self-determination and self-sufficiency. Unemployment in some towns now runs as high as 15%, and the standard of food in the shops is often rudimentary. And while the number of people living below the poverty line was last measured at 9% – lower than in the United Kingdom – the suicide rate here increased from a historically very low level in the 70s to one of the highest in the world by the mid-90s, at 107 per 100,000 people. Clearly, politicians in Nuuk regard economic and political independence as the path to a better future for their people. (This, remember, is a country that has already stuck its nose up to the west by leaving a club that everyone wants to join: the European Union.) But while they want to see more oil exploration – and hopefully production – they also insist their safety regulations meet the world's toughest standards, aware that most Greenlanders fear the health issues that could arise from an influx of oil companies. The politicians' and public's views on global warming – another key reason for Greenpeace's presence in Baffin Bay – are more mixed, however. Global warming might be threatening to harpoon the local hunting way of life, but it will also lessen the hardships of living in a country where burying dead bodies in the frozen ground can be problematic. The melting of the local ice cap, which currently covers 80% of the country's land mass, will raise sea levels in countries such as Bangladesh and the Maldives – but it could open up further economic opportunities in Greenland. In future, Nuuk might act as a lucrative stop-off point for ships traversing the world via the currently iced-up North West Passage, and also make it a centre of onshore mineral mining. \"Yes, we are gaining more land, you can say that,\" says Stendal. And a spokesman from the Greenland Natural Institute of Resources and Climate Change talks about the possibility of \"golden years\" ahead, as the temperature warms up. This is not the only unexpected view that foreign visitors encounter in Nuuk. Greenpeace, which has hero status in most capitals of the world, is fairly unpopular here, even among the young – not so much because the environmental group is opposed to an oil industry that could be good for Greenland's political self-determination, but because it once opposed seal hunting. Greenpeace now says its campaign was only ever aimed at \"unsustainable\" activities in Canada, but it admits that Greenland got caught in the slipstream, because any kind of seal hunting was deemed unacceptable by a north European public. As a result, what was a healthy export trade of the distinctive and mottled skins has been stopped in its tracks. Seal skins still cover rows of seats in the otherwise rudimentary airport lounges around this vast country, but only locals will buy a seal-skin waistcoat. So, while a top team of daredevil environmentalists has led (only temporarily successful) raids on the Cairn rig, others have been making an equally brave attempt to appease vocal critics in Nuuk – without, apparently, much success. Political correctness as prescribed by the west is not something that hangs heavy in the priorities of the Greenlander. The tourism industry on the island is built around the top end of the market, not least because it costs a pretty penny to fly here, involving a transit in Denmark or Iceland. Once here, visitors are still forced to move around by plane because no towns are connected by road – in fact, there are only two traffic lights on the entire island, a vast country of 840,000 square miles. It is hardly an easy place for Nive Nielsen to fulfil her musical ambitions. Despite having recorded in Britain, she must still shrug off depressing attempts to label her Deer Children band \"eskimo rock\", and ignorant questions such as \"How do you plug in an electric guitar in an igloo?\" But Nielsen, and her fellow Greenlanders too, are determined to shape their own destiny – with or without oil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/jan/11/nuclearpower.alternativeenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-11T15:38:34Z","webTitle":"Little common ground as debate warms up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/11/nuclearpower.alternativeenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/jan/11/nuclearpower.alternativeenergy","fields":{"headline":"Little common ground as debate warms up","bodyText":"For The power industry and the City broadly welcomed the nuclear white paper yesterday.

The purpose of this \"have your say\" was to open up, as far as we could, an important bit of Guardian tradition: the editor's meeting at which all Guardian journalists can air their views of what the leader line should be, before the leader writers retire to some hallowed inner sanctum to compose whatever oracular statement the Guardian finally makes on the subject. Your response was spectacular. Between 7.30am and the start of the meeting at 1.15pm, in excess of 1,200 comments were posted. At the time of writing, the total stands at more than 1,500. Even a cursory skim through the thread will tell you two things. While this is no scientific sample (and no opinion poll), an overwhelming majority of commenters urged the Guardian to back the Liberal Democrats. But just as significantly, the key reason why most of those who posted wish to see that is – necessarily summarising and simplifying hundreds of fascinating contributions – because you want to see real political change, vitally including electoral reform. And to most of you, Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats look like that change or the best bet for it. That was the message we Ciffers took into the meeting – in the Guardian's Scott Room, whose walls were lined with sheets displaying a selection of your comments from the thread. With at least 200 people in the room, one issue at least was immediately clear: the air conditioning wasn't up to the job. As is also traditional at such gatherings, the Guardian's instinct for democracy and egalitarianism wars with an obscure combination of deference to the senior editors and columnists and an \"I'll-sit-at-the-back-of-the-class\" rebelliousness. This tension gets resolved in a delicate hierarchical compromise, with inner circle chairs occupied by the big beasts, with some secondary ranks behind, and then a standing crowd of silent spectators and occasionally noisy dissenters. The editor, Alan Rusbridger, kicked off proceedings by reminding us why we were there – to honour the unique institution in Fleet Street of a news media organisation, independent and not beholden to proprietor or shareholders, holding such a consultative, \"sounding-board\" meeting with staff about such a central question of editorial policy. He then laid out seven areas of policy and principle to guide discussion: the economy, constitutional reform, foreign policy, public services, social justice, the environment and civil liberties. From here, I'm observing Chatham House rules and not attributing remarks, but will try to summarise and give you a flavour of the debate. On the economy, the discussion focused on Labour's record: on the one hand, its management of the recession has been creditable and things could have been so much worse; on the other hand, the responsibility for the regulatory failures during the previous decade's boom is largely Labour's too. The bottom line, though, is that Labour is still the most redistributive party – for all its failures and timidity on that score. As one said (you might guess who): \"Labour always remembers the poorest,\" whereas, historically, the Liberal Democrats are a party of the centre that looks out for the middle strata of society and tackling poverty is not in their DNA, as it is for Labour. It was then that Michael White (no comment attributed, so I'm going to tell you) diverted everyone by starting to tear up a copy of the Financial Times as someone was speaking. It wasn't that he was bored and resorting to origami; he just wanted to clip an article for the editor that showed that more Guardian readers intend to vote Tory than vote Green. Jumping to foreign policy, a consensus soon emerged that the Guardian's editorial positions are most closely aligned, of all the three parties, with the Liberal Democrats' prospectus. On Europe, especially, Cameron's Conservatives are a cause for concern, in contrast to a more realist Liberal Democrat attitude than in past times. Clegg's scepticism on replacing Trident suited many, too; and on Britain's role in the world, a less fetishistic attitude towards the \"special relationship\" with the US, and human rights, the Lib Dems tick Guardian boxes that Labour leaves blank. Brown's attack on Clegg in the leaders' debate for being \"anti-American\" seemed clumsy and ill-judged, it was said; after all, it was only the Liberal Democrats, of the main parties, who had shared the Guardian's opposition to the Iraq war. Moving to public services, the debate was wide open. There is doubt about Labour's centralised mode of delivery and its target-driven record. Have people had enough of the big state, and are both the Tories and Lib Dems more in tune with the public mood by promising more devolved services and local control? As one said: \"Labour has real achievements, but there are big questions to answer.\" On the other hand, the older hands at the Guardian – and among the electorate – still have the memory of past recessions under Conservative governments when cuts in public spending were harsh and not \"humane\". A voice from the standing contingent also observed crisply that, whatever Clegg and Cable might say about public spending, there is plenty of evidence of Liberal Democrats in local government being anything but liberal in their approach to services and cuts. Constitutional reform energised discussion. A senior web editor observed that not just in today's open thread, but throughout our election coverage, there has been an incredibly high level of engagement from users and the dominant theme has been the desire for change and reform – for a new politics. Labour did push through devolution a decade ago, and has done plenty of constitutional tinkering since, but the party is a late and lukewarm convert to voting reform. Where the Guardian has long been on political reform (in some areas, for more than a century), there also, by and large, are the Liberal Democrats. And on civil liberties, which the Guardian has championed, most recently through liberty central, the Lib Dems score a home run, it was agreed. On the environment, the verdict is that Labour has come late to the party, but have finally started to get things done – slowly building a new green economy, with jobs and growth in the renewable energy industry, for instance. There was a feeling, too, that however strongly Cameron had run on the environmental message in the early days of his leadership, he has not ultimately succeeded in selling that message to substantial portions of his party base and hierarchy. Again, the Liberal Democrats have long been on the right ground on the environment – although, as a senior editor observed, their opposition to nuclear power is hard to square with Britain's commitment to cutting carbon emissions. At that point, discussion of the big policy areas came to a close – although not before the point had been raised that we had barely discussed the issue that has, for the public, dominated the election campaign coverage, galvanised by the leaders' debates: the personalities of the three leaders themselves and their relative merits. The editor moved the debate on to the decisive questions of how to translate the Guardian's values and principles into a succinct editorial message – as he put it, separating the matters of principle from the pragmatic issue of how to reconcile them with the First Past the Post system we have. Opening, one said there was \"a consensus in favour of some form of 'Lib-Lab-ery'\"; as another then chimed, \"If there were a box [on the ballot paper] you could tick, it would be for a hung parliament – but you can't vote for that.\" So immediately, we were into the mechanics of how to get the reform we all want (no one was mounting a defence of First Past the Past, for instance). But how to address the question of \"progressive alliances\" and tactical voting in the most unpredictable, poised and unstable general election in decades? There was a strong feeling from several quarters that the Guardian should not necessarily plump for one party over another, but instead, in tune with what feels like the public mood, \"vote with our values\" – say that we want change and reform, and leave it to voters to decide the rest. And this is where your Cif representatives in the room spoke up to convey a sense of what you had been telling us, reading from the thread: strong support for the Liberal Democrats, not necessarily to see them in government and Nick Clegg as prime minister, but with a powerful current of desire for a new politics – the resurgent great theme of the last year. Some election veterans and harder-headed realists wanted to see a firmer message in favour of Labour, on the grounds that there is a real risk that a collapse in Labour's vote, even with a big turnout for the Liberal Democrats, would be most likely to deliver a minority Conservative government or even a majority for Cameron. What is certain, though, is that creating at least some kind of window for the world to this internal Guardian exercise brought an even greater sense of energy and engagement to an already unexpectedly exciting election. Thank you for sharing your views with us. The Guardian's election leader will be written and published in the newspaper and here on Comment is free later next week. But if, in the meantime, you have any bright ideas about how to manage the electoral mechanics to ensure the optimal outcome for the reform we all want – and then how to express that with clarity and conviction in an editorial – please post below. All ideas welcome. • More Guardian election comment from Cif at the polls"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2009/mar/18/nuclear-weapons-trident","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-18T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Brown puts Trident cuts on nuclear arms talks table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/18/nuclear-weapons-trident","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/mar/18/nuclear-weapons-trident","fields":{"headline":"Brown puts Trident cuts on nuclear arms talks table","bodyText":"The UK will begin to scale back its stockpile of nuclear warheads if Russia and the US agree to new reductions, the prime minister said yesterday, as he gave warning that Iran faces harsher penalties if attempts to enrich uranium continue. Speaking to scientists and diplomats from 37 countries at Lancaster House in London, Gordon Brown said that as one of the six nations with confirmed nuclear capability the UK had to show the lead by striking \"a global bargain\". The next international five-yearly proliferation review conference is due next year. Brown said: \"Step by step, we have to transform the discussion of nuclear disarmament from one of platitudes to one of hard commitments. \"Britain has cut the number of its nuclear warheads by 50% since 1997 ... If it is possible to reduce the number of UK warheads further, Britain will be ready to do so.\" Though the UK's warheads now number fewer than 160, the government has provoked anger by announcing a £20bn programme to build four new submarines and taking part in an American programme to extend the life of the Trident D5 missile. However, yesterday even the prime minister's critics welcomed his comments, with Nigel Griffiths, who resigned as a government aide in 2007 in protest at the decision to renew Trident, saying it was a significant step. \"Gordon Brown's message that he wants to see the number of nuclear weapons reduced, that UK numbers are not fixed and that he is ready to work reduce them further, is a significant step towards a safer and eventually nuclear-weapon-free world,\" Griffiths said. \"This is real leadership which is bound to influence both the US and Russia, as well as sending a clear message to those regimes who are seeking to acquire nuclear weapons to turn away from putting the power of the atom to destructive ends and embrace the potential of peaceful nuclear power stations to meet the world's increasing and dangerous reliance on fossil fuels.\" The Scottish National party said it welcomed the move but called on Brown to lead by example and scrap Trident. The submarines that carry Trident missiles are based on the Clyde estuary. Brown also outlined a new international mechanism whereby countries could buy uranium enrichment bonds as long as they could prove they were intended for civilian power. This, it was claimed, would be a true test of whether Iran was only interested in enriching uranium for civilian use. Iran insists it only wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes and has pledged to press on with the programme. It is defying UN security council resolutions ordering suspension of the enrichment of uranium, saying such processing is permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The security council says the Iranians should stop enrichment until their peaceful intentions can be fully established. The prime minister's proposals also include changes to the sanctions regime whereby, should a country pull out of the non-proliferation treaty, as North Korea has done, that country would face automatic sanctions. However, Brown's threat of more sanctions was not backed up by evidence that Russia or China would agree - vital for the security council to act. Key in securing greater leverage over Iran will be President Obama's first meeting with the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, at the G20 summit in London next month. The prime minister urged Iran to \"take advantage of the international community's willingness to negotiate, including President Obama's offer of engagement, rather than face further sanctions\". Obama has said that the United States is prepared to extend a hand of peace to Iran if it \"unclenched its fist\". However, the overture has met with a mixed response from Tehran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2007/may/23/nuclear.immigrationpolicy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-23T06:51:19Z","webTitle":"Ministers to press on with new nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/23/nuclear.immigrationpolicy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2007/may/23/nuclear.immigrationpolicy","fields":{"headline":"Ministers to press on with new nuclear power stations","bodyText":"The government will today reassert its determination to press ahead with a new generation of nuclear power stations despite evidence of Tony Blair's inability to convince many of his own backbenchers and the public at large that atomic energy holds the key to security of supply and lower carbon emissions. An energy white paper published today will promise further consultation on the issue as demanded by the high court following a challenge by Greenpeace, but industry secretary Alistair Darling will make clear his belief that nuclear is essential if the UK is to meet growing energy demands and meet its Kyoto treaty commitments on C02. But the government faces battles ahead. A group of Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs warn in a letter published in today's Guardian that \"we should not be politically panicked into accepting a technology that poses a continuing risk in terms of weapons proliferation and terrorism, produces a toxic waste for which no management solution is agreed, benefits from hidden subsidies and tends to undermine the prospects of renewable energy and efforts to increase efficiency\". The letter, also signed by Friends of the Earth, said it was a \"myth\" that the lights would go out or that Britain would be far less dependent on gas imports without nuclear. A Guardian/ICM poll out this week shows opponents of nuclear energy narrowly outnumber supporters, by 49% to 44%, underlining how the government has made no progress in persuading people of the case for nuclear energy. When the Guardian last asked voters their opinion on the issue, in late 2005, 45% backed nuclear energy and 48% opposed it. The poll also shows that 62% of men think more nuclear power stations should be built against 27% of women. But industry has become increasingly positive with the huge German utility E.ON, which is fast-expanding in Britain and which sponsored last Saturday's FA Cup, saying for the first time that it was ready and willing to build new plants here and could do so without subsidies. \"E.ON is keen to take a leading role in the development of a next generation nuclear programme,\" said Paul Golby, the chief executive of E.ON UK. \"We believe that private companies will be able to fully fund the next generation nuclear build but it clearly requires sustained political and public support,\" he added. The company denied that nuclear would push out other forms of investment citing its commitment to spend £3bn on a variety of new gas and clean coal-fired power stations, together with wind, biomass and marine projects across the country. Mr Golby added: \"This white paper should not be all about nuclear and our plans are suitably diverse - to keep UK plc's lights on we need to look at all our options and not just at one.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/richard-adams-blog/2010/oct/15/us-midterm-elections-2010-live-blog","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-15T10:58:16Z","webTitle":"Midterm elections live blog - Friday 15 October","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/oct/15/us-midterm-elections-2010-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/oct/15/us-midterm-elections-2010-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Midterm elections live blog - Friday 15 October","bodyText":"Good morning. Today's straw for Democrats to clutch at is this data from the Pew Research Centre suggesting an in-built bias towards Republican voters thanks to the effect of cell phone-only households. A quarter of all US households now have only a cell phone and so cannot be reached on a landline telephone by most pollsters. According to Pew: In three of four election polls conducted since the spring of this year, estimates from the landline samples alone produced slightly more support for Republican candidates and less support for Democratic candidates, resulting in differences of four to six [percentage] points in the margin. We'll see on 2 November. In the meantime, catch up with all yesterday's action. 7am ET: Simon Jeffery with some catch-up items. Nevada Senate candidates Harry Reid and Sharron Angle debated for the one and only time in this election campaign. Reid called Angle \"extreme\"; Angle told Reid to \"man up\". Nevadans also have the option on 2 November to vote \"None of the above\". This was Taegan Goddard's Twitter verdict: If you're watching the NV-Sen debate, you'll see why Reid and Angle have 60% disapproval rates... Barack Obama encountered disatisified young people at an MTV forum. According to this report, tweets to the president included such statements as \"My greatest fear is that we are turning into a Communist country\". Sure that should be a lower case c. 7.20am ET: Former Alaska senator Ted Stevens died in a plane crash in August, but that won't stop him making a return to state politics when he makes a cameo appearance in a Lisa Murkowski campaign ad. Stevens made the recordings before his death and now Murkowski is releasing them. Yes, just like what they did with 2Pac. 7.25am ET: A Democratic candidate whose most recent campaign ad showed him firing a rifle at a piece of climate change legislation is 10 points up in the West Virginia Senate race. Joe Manchin is running in a special election to succeed the late Robert Byrd. Byrd did not leave a back catalogue of unreleased campaign ads for Manchin to plunder, as far as we know. 7.55am ET: The New York Times has identified 138 Tea Party candidates running in House and Senate races. It also handily divides them into groups such as \"newcomers\", \"newly energised\" and \"birthers\". 8.08am ET: Shady Mexicans creeping through a fence. Check. Huge novelty cheque for \"a lot of taxpayer money\" to \"all illegal aliens\" on the US side. Check. A marching band and limo to make them feel really welcome. Check. Josh Marshall of TPM says this attack ad from Louisana Senator David Vitter against his Democratic opponent, Charlie Melancon, \"might be the most amazing ad that a Republican has ever put out on illegal immigration\". I think he might be right. 9.15am ET: Some background: former World Wrestling Entertainment head Linda McMahon is Republican candidate in the Connecticut Senate race. Democrats in the state have run ads attacking her business experience, saying her company, unnamed in the ads, \"tolerated steroid and drug use\" and inserted \"death clauses\" into contracts. How can she be trusted? WWE has struck back that this is all a bit, well, inconsistent of the Democrats considering what 2008 presidential candidates, two of whom you may recognise as Democrats, said when they tried to reach out to the pro wrestling demographic as part of the \"Smackdown the vote\" initiative. Obama: \"So to the special interests, who have been setting the agenda in Washington for too long [...] I have one question: Do you smell what Barack is cooking?\" Clinton: \"In honor of the WWE, you can call me Hill-Rod. This election is starting to feel a lot like King of the Ring. The only difference: the last man standing may just be a woman\" And here is the Republican McCain: \"Whatcha gonna do when John McCain and all his 'McCainiacs' run wild on you? You want to pull out of Iraq? Well I say no surrender\" There is video of all three. If it's cringe you're after, I recommend McCain's: \"How are ya South Carolina?\" he begins. \"Finally the Mac has come back to Greenville ...\" 9.53am ET: I'm now handing over to Richard Adams for the rest of the day's campainging. 10.09am: Thank you Simon and good morning from Washington DC. There's a lot going on today as well as the burning embers of last night's various debates. But first: this could become an election talking point very quickly: Russia agreed to build Venezuela's first nuclear power plant after talks in Moscow between the countries' leaders, Dmitry Medvedev and Hugo Chavez. Gather pigeons, insert cat. 10.20am: Marginally off-topic but here's the Tweet of the Day (so far): Federal employees can purchase health insurance for their pets but not their same-sex partner: http://bit.ly/bzElPJ It's true. US government employees insured through the Federal Employees Health Benefits programme received an email from Aetna advertising their new pet insurance. But the the Defense of Marriage Act denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. 10.37am: Here's the \"Dead Ted\" ad that we mentioned earlier, with the daughter of former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens introducing an ad he made supporting Lisa Murkowski before he died in a plane crash in August. Declining to run the ad, Murkowski lost the GOP primary to Tea Party beard-wearer Joe Miller and is running as a write-in candidate against Miller. \"Now my family want you to hear for yourself how strongly he felt about the need to re-elect Lisa,\" says Stevens's daughter Sue Covich. In a tight race an ad such as this is electoral gold. 10.54am: It's not just the US that's having an election soon! Yes, Our Friend To The North (Canada) is also holding some sort of crude democratic voting-type event later this month. Of course, Canadians would never stoop so low as to use some of the vicious attack ads that US politicians hurl at each other. Would they? Hmm, not so sure: this one about Winnipeg mayor Sam Katz is supported by FOPATKITFOC, or \"Friends of people against the kicking in the face of children\". 11.20am: Fantastic piece by TA Frank in the New Republic on last night's Senate debate in the Silver State between Harry Reid and Tea Party person Sharron Angle. Frank make a good case that Reid blew it badly, meaning that he's handed his senate seat to Angle: I could go on with my laments about Reid's performance – about how he fumbled an answer on Social Security, about how he picked Antonin Scalia and Byron \"Whizzer\" White as particular Supreme Court favorites, about how he couldn't find his closing statement and wound up shuffling through his papers and then reading something that didn't really work anyway. But we're all busy people. Oh well, so much for Nevada. 11.47am: The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee has a barrel-scraping ad up against Republican Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, accusing him of exporting jobs to China, complete with cliches such as fortune cookies and gongs on the soundtrack. It says: \"In Congress Toomey voted to give China special trade status\". Ah, would that be the law signed by ... President Clinton in 2000? 12 noon: Time for a lunchtime wrap-up of the news from the midterm election trail. • Black voters are still energised and more likely to get out and cast ballots in November, writes the Washington Post • Slate's Dave Weigel reports on the bizarre Republican and Tea Party trench warfare in Colorado • The economy is still far and away the single biggest issue for voters. And nobody cares about Afghanistan • The New York Times prepares for a Republican majority in Congress with a profile of the man who would be the next Speaker of the House, John Boehner 12.28pm: The Quote of the Day comes from the Republican Missouri Senate candidate Roy Blunt, debating his Democratic rival Robin Carnahan last night: \"You could tweet her jobs plan in four tweets.\" 1pm: Ask not for whom the poll tells, it tells for these crucial Senate swing states that the Democrats need to hold, in today's polling round-up: • West Virginia: a Marshall University poll finds Democrat Joe Manchin now leading Republican John Raese by 10 points, by 48% to 38%. Was the \"hicky\" actor ad? • Delaware: a Rasmussen robo-poll puts Chris Coons on 51% and Christine O'Donnell on 40%, taken after Wednesday's debate and showing movement towards Coons • Illinois: An internal poll commissioned by Democrat Alex Giannoulias gives him 44% and his Republican opponent Mark Kirk 41%. Internals polls can be a bit iffy. 1.31pm: Speaking of iffy polls, earlier today we mentioned the problems caused by trying to reach \"cell phone only\" households – the growing number of people who live without a conventional landline, now about 25% of all US households. That may create a bias towards Republicans in polls since Republican supporters are more likely to have landlines, according to research by Pew. Polling guru Nate Silver isn't so sure, and says so: Clearly, this is a major problem in survey research – and one that, sooner or later, every polling firm is going to have to wrestle with. What isn't as clear is how much of a problem it is right now. So Democrats, don't get your hopes up. 2.04pm: The New York Times's usually dull Caucus blog has an actual news story: The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will report later this afternoon that the organization raised $15.5 million in September, its largest one-month haul ever. Sadly all the underground, astroturfing Republican-leaning special interest groups allowed since Citizens United court decision have raised, oh, about a trillion-ish dollars this month. 2.47pm: Remember Sarah Palin? \"In a speech that seemed crafted for Tea Party followers more than curious Canadians,\" reports the Globe &amp; Mail of a trip that Palin did north of the border to Vancouver. Well, south of the border for Palin. Lucky Canadians paid $500 to be in the audience, although the G&amp;M is fairly sniffy about her performance, quoting her as saying: \"[T]here are not enough monies in the entire world to cover our debts right now,\" which is plainly nonsense, and concluding: \"There were very few specifics, however, on what Ms Palin would cut to reduce government debt.\" Anyway, here's something to look forward to: She seemed to agree with one person who suggested she allowed herself to be too programmed by Republican presidential candidate John McCain's handlers during the pair's bid for the White House. \"Thanks for the advice,\" said Ms Palin, at the event ostensibly to plug her book Going Rogue. \"When I do run again I will be more rogue.\" More rogue! (Also: Ms Palin?) 3.13pm: This week's political catch phrase appears to be used by women candidates when debating male opponents: \"Man up\". In last night's debates Sharron Angle told Harry Reid to \"man up\", while in a party reversal Democrat Robin Carnahan advised Roy Blunt to \"man up\" almost simultaneously. The Wall Street Journal's bloggers have noticed this trend: Maybe it's just human nature. For years, men have been exhorted to get in touch with their feminine sides. Now, male candidates are now being told to \"man up!\" For which we can probably thank Christine O'Donnell, who used similar tactics in her primary contest against Mike Castle last month, at one point complaining: \"These are the kind of cheap, underhanded, un-manly tactics that we've come to expect from Obama's favorite Republican, Mike Castle. You know, I released a statement today, saying Mike this is not a bake-off, get your man-pants on.\" 3.56pm: The Guardian's Gary Younge is reporting from Colorado and has a long piece on Obama's popularity and the state of the Democratic party nearly two years after the euphoria of 2008: The good news for Democrats is that their supporters are not going over to the Republicans. The bad news is they aren't necessarily going to the polls, either.... They have to reframe the last two years not as the dispiriting end of a lost opportunity but the tough beginning of a transformational period. Slate's Dave Weigel is also in Colorado, following around the dueling Republican and Democratic Senate candidates as they hunt for votes, and reports: Sooner or later, if you are a member of the United States Senate, you will be asked why the government won't pay for Viagra. The question was from a 73 year old who presumably wants to \"man up\". 4.07pm: This headline from The Hill sums up an entire news article in 12 words: Obama, Biden heap praise on Coons and each other at Delaware rally 4.42pm: Polling you, polling me: more polls seep out this Friday afternoon in two key Senate races on the West Coast. Lose either California or Washington and the Democrats could lose control of the Senate • California: Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer's battle with Republican Carly Fiorina is basically a tie, with Boxer leading by just 46% to 45% • Yet another poll for Califonia's Senate race, this time from Rasmussen, and it has a very similar message: Boxer on 49% and Fiorina on 46%, so well within the margin of error of 4 points and essentially neck and neck • A University of Washington poll has incumbent Democrat Patty Murray on 50% compared with challenger Dino Rossi on 42%, the second poll with those numbers this week. Women voters seem to be giving Murray the edge 5.20pm: Ah, here's Rupert Murdoch defending his decision to donate $1m of News Corp's money to the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Republican Governors Association, during News Corp's annual meeting (via the New York Times): \"We judged it to be in the best interest of the company,'' Mr Murdoch said in response to the first question about the donations, from Laura Shaffer Campos, who said she was there representing the AFL-CIO Reserve Fund and the Nathan Cummings Foundation. \"It has nothing to do with the editorial policies or the journalism or the films or anything else,'' he said, indirectly referring to the News Corp outlets like Fox News Channel and The Wall Street Journal. He continued, \"It is certainly in the interests of the country and of all the shareholders and the prosperity of the – that there be a fair amount of change in Washington.\" When pressed further by a representative of the Massachusetts Laborers Pension Fund, Mr Murdoch said testily, \"They were unusual and we made them because we decided that that was in the interests of our shareholders and of the country.\" To paraphrase someone, what's good for News Corp is good for America, according to Rupert Murdoch. 6pm: Let's wrap this up for the weekend. Only 18 more days to go until election day. So what did we learn on Friday 15 October? • Polls are tightening as the barrage of ads is at full flow and voters make up their minds. If anything this week saw a slight swing back towards the Democrats although Wisconsin's senate seat is slipping away • Candidates' debates fail to make much impact. Given the level of coaching of candidates these days, no one has so far dropped the ball but Harry Reid and Christine O'Donnell were unconvincing • Issue number one for voters remains the weak economy, with housing and unemployment as particular worries • \"Man up\" is the phrase of the day among women candidates attacking their male opponents And to put us all in the mood for the weekend here's a fun video about voting (via Roger Ebert)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/mar/28/un-climate-change-meeting-london","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-28T00:06:58Z","webTitle":"The trillion-dollar question is: who will now lead the climate battle?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/28/un-climate-change-meeting-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/mar/28/un-climate-change-meeting-london","fields":{"headline":"The trillion-dollar question is: who will now lead the climate battle?","bodyText":"Some of the planet's most powerful paymasters will gather in London on Wednesday to discuss a nagging financial problem: how to raise a trillion dollars for the developing world. Those charged with achieving this daunting goal will include Gordon Brown, directors of several central banks, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros, the economist Lord (Nicholas) Stern and Larry Summers, President Obama's chief economics adviser. As an array of expertise, it is formidable: but then so is the task they have been set by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. In effect, the world's top financiers have been told to work out how to raise at least $100bn a year for the rest of this decade, cash that will be used to help the world's poorest countries adapt to climate change. \"The prices we pay for our goods do not reflect one key cost: the damage that their production does to the planet's climate system,\" said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the LSE. \"We need to find ways to extract payment from those who cause that damage and then use that money to fund developing nations so that they can protect themselves from the worst effects of global warming.\" And to raise those funds the Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing has made clear that it will consider everything – from placing levies on international aviation and shipping, to enlarging carbon markets, introducing financial transaction taxes and using the International Monetary Fund's special reserve currency. You name it and it will be run up the flagpole – for success in establishing a developing world finance plan is now considered crucial to the success of next December's UN climate change meeting in Mexico. \"Finance is a prerequisite for a climate agreement,\" said Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climage Change, on Friday. \"Developing countries are very sensitive about this. Talks will collapse without strong and secure financing in place.\" It sounds familiar, and so it should: these new discussions mark a renewal of global climate talks that ended only three months ago at the Copenhagen UN summit, which failed to set a deal to control emissions of carbon dioxide. Politicians and negotiators are preparing another assault on the issue, though this time talks will be very different. For a start, climate science has suffered damaging setbacks. There was the leaking from the University of East Anglia's climate research unit of email exchanges between some of the world's top meteorologists as well as the discovery that a UN assessment report on climate change had vastly exaggerated the rate of melting of Himalayan glaciers. The former revelation suggested some researchers were involved in massaging the truth, sceptics claimed, while the latter exposed deficiencies in the way the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – authors of the report – go about their business. The overall effect has been to damage the credibility of the large number of scientists who fear our planet faces climatic disaster. Trying to restart stalled negotiations will be very hard. Yet increased scepticism is only part of the problem for negotiators. Since December, new political groupings have emerged. China, India, South Africa and Brazil, known as the \"Basics\" nations, have assumed climate leadership roles, while the European Union has retreated from the front line. Nothing is quite what it was. Consider the US. Obama – fresh from his successes in passing his health bill and his nuclear arms talks with Russia – has indicated he is turning his attention to climate change. At an hour-long meeting last week, his climate and energy adviser Carol Browner and White House legislative affairs director Phil Schiliro discussed the prospects of a climate change bill with Senate leader Harry Reid and other senior Capitol Hill Democrats. Three senators – Democrat John Kerry, independent Joe Lieberman and Republican Lindsey Graham – have also been holding talks to draw up legislation. Their planned bill looks set to be released next month. For campaigners, these developments seem encouraging, while Obama's critics are angry. \"The administration has shown it is prepared to draw up a partisan bill and force it through. If that is their model of governing, then there is no limit to what they will do,\" said Ken Green, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative thinktank. A US climate law will be primarily aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. But the devil, as always, will be in the details, for the bill is likely to include many provisions that will anger the green lobby. Graham wants to include measures that would boost offshore oil drilling on America's continental shelf, while recent leaks suggest funds may be provided for so-called \"clean coal\" power stations. In addition, there is likely to be support for nuclear power. All three ideas are reviled by environmentalists. Barack Obama's move on climate change is therefore far less radical than it seems, for the simple fact is that there is little political appetite to repeat the dramas that marred healthcare reform. The new legislation will therefore be softened in order to ensure Republican support. \"It is not going to be a one-party push. I am sure we can get 60 votes to support this,\" said Tad Segal, a spokesman for the US Climate Action Partnership, a coalition of environmental and business groups in favour of new laws limiting emissions. As Washington insiders know all too well, that is the way US law is passed, no matter what the concerns of the rest of the planet. \"In America, even with climate change, all politics is local,\" said Segal. The prospect of such a weak US move on climate change has not gone down well. \"Countries are losing patience with the US. There may be sympathy for Obama, who clearly faces a difficult domestic situation, but it is now clear that the US wants to take another path on climate change and is demanding everyone goes with it,\" said a source in one European embassy last week. This point was backed by Liz Gallagher of Cafod, the Roman Catholic development agency. \"The talks cannot go back to where they were. The rest of the world has realised that the US will not change and the only way to progress may be to leave the US behind and show them that they will lose out in the green race.\" This difference in attitude is likely to reach a showdown in Bonn next month over which negotiating text is used for future discussions. The US wants to adopt the weak accord agreed in Copenhagen, while most developing countries – including China, India and Brazil – say it has no legal standing and that the talks must continue with the far stronger framework that was agreed at Kyoto a decade earlier. Significantly, this latter group is backed by the distinguished UN climate chief Yvo de Boer. \"I think we'll continue on the two-track approach. For the developing countries, the presence of the Kyoto protocol is very important,\" he said. He is also supported by more than 200 of the world's largest environment and development groups, including Friends of the Earth International, Christian Aid, Third World Network, Jubilee South and the World Development Movement, which have called for a total rejection of the Copenhagen accord and urged countries to resume twin-track talks. However, other observers believe the US has in effect forced its views on the world because no rich country is prepared to take it on. \"We are in a world of disarray. The US is laughing and there is no evidence that rich countries have the appetite to take on the US and go it alone. It is a mess,\" said Martin Khor, director of the South Centre, an inter-governmental developing country think tank based in Geneva. It is a depressing backdrop for Wednesday's talks in London, but it does not mean that all is lost. \"If the US agrees to limit its emissions in only a modest way, that will be an immense improvement on America's previous stance,\" said the Grantham Research Institute's Ward. \"And while it may seem daunting to talk about raising a trillion dollars for developing nations to deal with the impact of global warming, we should note that this represents an investment that is far lower than the one that was required to save the world's financial system in 2008. \"Had it gone down, the consequences would have been grim. But if we don't face up to global warming, then the impact will be far worse. This point is not lost on the Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing and I think that we will get global action to tackle global warming very soon. We should not be too downhearted yet.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/jan/13/russia-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-13T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"New doubts as Russia agrees to resume gas supplies to Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/13/russia-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/jan/13/russia-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"New doubts as Russia agrees to resume gas supplies to Europe","bodyText":"The Russian energy giant Gazprom has promised to start pumping gas to Europe from this morning, a week after the pipelines from Siberia went empty, plunging half the continent into a winter fuel crisis. Alexander Medvedev, deputy chief executive of the state gas monopoly, indicated yesterday that the final hurdles in the two-week dispute with Ukraine had been removed in a deal brokered by the EU. But Igor Sechin, Russia's deputy prime minister and head of the energy sector, told the Guardian the resumption of supplies from 8am would be \"only a test delivery\". Most of the continent's gas imports from Russia arrive through the pipelines in Ukraine. The end to the dispute depends on EU monitors being allowed to verify the flow of gas in Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. Russian and Ukrainian experts are to join the European monitors. While the EU monitors were in position last night, Sechin said the Russian experts were not yet stationed in Ukraine, signalling that the deal could still be aborted. Differences over who should pay for \"fuel\" gas that is used to keep up the pressure in the pipelines for pumping the natural gas to clients could also disrupt the fragile accord and spell more misery for hundreds of thousands of households in central and southern Europe. Slovakia, which is dependent on Russian gas, said it would have to restart its decommissioned reactor at Bohunice, near the border with Austria, because it had received no supplies since Thursday. The nuclear plant is widely viewed as unsafe and its closure was one of the conditions for Slovakia joining the EU in 2004. Austria, which has banned nuclear power, deplored the move. The environment minister, Nikolaus Berlakovich, described decision to restart the Soviet-era reactor as \"completely unacceptable\". The European commission said any recommissioning of Bohunice would be a breach of European law and Bratislava's membership terms. • This article was amended on Thursday 15 January 2009. The Bohunice nuclear power station in Slovakia does not have a Chernobyl-design reactor. Its four reactors are of a different design.

In an ambitious speech that will alarm the anti-nuclear lobby, John Hutton, the business secretary, will argue that the UK's nuclear programme should go beyond replacing the existing stock of 23 reactors, which provide 20% of the country's energy. Instead nuclear should contribute \"a significantly higher proportion\" of the nation's energy needs in the years ahead, and Britain should aim to become a world leader in the development of nuclear power technology. He will argue that replacing the existing reactors will be equivalent to investment \"three times the size of the project to build Terminal 5 at Heathrow\", but that the economic benefits could be far greater if Britain went further. The speech, one of the most pro-nuclear delivered by a government minister, comes before an Anglo-French announcement to co-operate on the expansion of nuclear power. Hutton will say: \"There has never been a greater global demand for finance, equipment and skills to build and operate nuclear power stations. I want Britain to be leading the world in the development and application of this new generation of low carbon power technology.\" The government announced its approval of the construction of a new generation of nuclear power stations in January, along with a series of measures designed to attract the support of the private sector investors who will be expected to pay for the new reactors and their eventual decommissioning costs. The announcement was controversial, in part because of safety concerns about nuclear waste. But in his speech to Unite, Britain's largest union, which has 26,000 members in the energy sector, Hutton will attempt to focus attention on the potential economic gains to be achieved from the replacement of Britain's nuclear reactors. \"Just replacing our existing capacity alone will equate to three times the size of the project to build Terminal 5 at Heathrow. It could represent around £20bn worth of business for UK companies,\" he will say. \"And with no artificial cap to constrain the potential of new build in the UK, there is every reason to believe that the industry could be contributing a significantly higher proportion of the UK in the decades ahead. Creating thousands of long-term highly skilled jobs directly within the energy industry and throughout the supply chain, the prize could be massive.\" The prime minister, Gordon Brown, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, are due to agree a deal on the construction of a new generation of power stations and the export of nuclear technology around the world at tomorrow's so-called Arsenal summit at the Emirates football stadium in north London. In his speech, Hutton will argue that with countries around the world increasingly keen to develop low-carbon energy sources, Britain has the potential to become \"the gateway to a new nuclear renaissance across Europe\". Such a renaissance \"offers tremendous opportunities for highly skilled jobs across the breadth of the supply chain\". Hutton will describe the potential scale of each investment as \"breathtaking\". The construction of Sizewell B, in Suffolk, took seven years before its completion in 1995. At its peak, the project employed more than 4,000 people and involved more than 3,000 British companies, he will tell Unite. \"If UK companies are competitive, and we have the right skilled workforce and ambition, the bulk of the capital expenditure related to this programme will flow into this country, creating new jobs, markets and businesses,\" Hutton will say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2010/jan/26/martin-campbell-edge-of-darkness-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-26T21:30:01Z","webTitle":"Martin Campbell: Living on the edge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/26/martin-campbell-edge-of-darkness-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2010/jan/26/martin-campbell-edge-of-darkness-interview","fields":{"headline":"Martin Campbell: Living on the edge","bodyText":"He has directed a string of global box-office smashes and honed action film-making down to a fine art, but Martin Campbell doesn't scream and shout about it. Or himself. A relentlessly self-effacing man, he is keen, in his plainspoken New Zealander way, not to get \"too up myself\". In person, he looks quite tough, combining a lean physique with a convict's buzz-cut, but he is instantly friendly, if maddeningly modest about his achievements. As he discusses his career – which has taken him from New Zealand to Britain to Los Angeles, and from TV drama to blockbusters – one theme keeps recurring: that film-making is a team event, \"not an ego trip\". Yet Campbell is one of the world's top action movie directors, having twice rebooted the Bond franchise when it needed it most, bringing in first Pierce Brosnan (GoldenEye) and then Daniel Craig. Critical consensus holds that Casino Royale, which introduced Craig and sailed much closer to the spirit of Ian Fleming's books, was one of the highlights of the entire franchise. \"To be honest, I get too much credit for that,\" he says. \"Timing was more important on both movies. With GoldenEye, the franchise got locked into this legal fight. They couldn't make new Bond movies for about seven years. It was my first huge production. I figured if I did at least a yeoman-like job, it would be greeted as a complete revival of the series.\" He did, it was – and 10 years later, he returned to launch Craig. \"The producers felt it had gone off the rails a bit after Die Another Day [the last Brosnan outing], with invisible cars and all that. I told them, we have to go back to the books. We even discussed doing it as a period piece.\" He laughs. \"We settled on a more fucked-up character with a dark streak in him, drinking too much, dodgy liver – all that's in the book. In Casino, he also had a real relationship with a woman. He doesn't just have a dozen for king and country.\" Between Bonds, Campbell has knocked out more high-octane movies, from the vertiginous climbing thriller Vertical Limit to two swashbuckling Zorro films. But with his new movie, Edge of Darkness, which boasts Mel Gibson's first on-screen appearance in eight years, Campbell is coming full-circle: back to the TV project that made his name 25 years ago. Edge of Darkness was a revered 1985 metaphysical thriller that plugged into the heaviest political issues of its time; but the series also had a mystical aspect, with the main character, a police detective (Bob Peck), investigating dark goings-on in the nuclear power industry, assisted by the ghost of his murdered daughter (Joanne Whalley). Campbell's feature-length remake is a more streamlined revenger's tragedy, relocating the action to Boston, and starring Gibson, Ray Winstone and Danny Huston. The main problem,\" says Campbell, \"was how do you knock six hours down to two? Six hours was a luxury. There was breathing space for the ghost thing to work. Not only that, nowadays the political situation has completely changed. None of that mid-80s stuff is scary any more. It's like everyone has plutonium in their back garden now. And shooting it during the miners' strike gave all the political aspects more power. Terrible days – but, boy, they were interesting.\" Campbell was initially lukewarm about revisiting the series when someone first suggested it in 2000. But then a writer gave him a script and the British producer Graham King – who worked with Scorsese on the multi-Oscar-winning The Departed – promised to finance it, simply because he had loved the TV series. The original, written by Troy Kennedy Martin, establishes itself as something dark and complex right from the start, when Peck goes through his daughter's bedside drawer shortly after her murder. He finds a vibrator, looks at it quizzically, then kisses it tenderly. \"It's very interesting, that dildo. When you see it on the page you think, this is just ridiculous, but Troy was very clever, and Bob Peck did it so beautifully. It's so simple, such a lovely gesture. But you can imagine what would have happened if we'd tried that in the remake – especially with Mel! It would have lit all sorts of fuses. So we backed away.\" What was Gibson like to direct? \"Well, it's a different Mel now, isn't it? All lean and hard as granite. He looks like a real don't-fuck-with-me sort of guy. In the Lethal Weapon movies, his face is always working away, but here I thought we'd say a great deal with less. I pulled it all out of him, all his tics. I wouldn't let him even twitch. And he looks magnificent.\" Campbell was born in Hastings, on New Zealand's North Island, in 1940, but looks 20 years younger than his 69 years. \"I tried to get a job as a TV cameraman and they basically told me, 'You're mad, everyone wants these jobs – and if you go to England, you're doubly mad.' But I worked in abattoirs for 10 months to earn my money, then left for London. I didn't even know what a director did.\" Arriving in Britain in 1965, he finagled his way into the BBC as a trainee cameraman. By the time he finally felt ready to direct, all the US money that had bankrolled Britain's 1960s film renaissance had gone back home. Among the refuse left behind was the bawdy sex-comedy genre, typified by movies like Confessions of a Window Cleaner. \"I did two sex films. Well, I say 'sex' films – they only showed a few bare breasts. The first was The Sex Thief.\" This 1973 oddity centred on a suave cat burglar who sleeps with posh women and then steals their jewels. The other, Three for All, starred Diana Dors, Hattie Jacques, Robert Lindsay and Richard Beckinsale. \"They were all in that!\" says Campbell, with a laugh. \"Of course, the only time any of those movies was ever on the telly was right in the middle of Edge of Darkness, so I got fingered.\" A crate of ale under the desk Somehow, he made it from there into the BBC's plays department, a period in his career that culminated in Edge of Darkness. \"To be absolutely honest, I miss it a lot. I know there's more money and bigger budgets now, but they were better times. You don't get those lightning-in-a-bottle directors you used to stumble across: Ken Loach, Alan Clarke. And writers who understood texture and grit, like Peter McDougall [A Sense of Freedom, Just Another Saturday]: fantastic writer, kept a crate of brown ale under his desk. We stretched every penny. That's how I learned to handle these big epic movies. We made great stuff back then. All the time.\" Campbell is currently working on The Green Lantern, starring Canadian heart-throb Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, better known as Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl. \"It's more Iron Man than Batman Begins,\" says Campbell of the project, which is a return to the gigantic project-management style of direction. \"I've been offered a superhero before, but I turned them all down. This had something extra I liked. Whereas Superman only has to defeat Kryptonite, this guy's superpower is willpower: he can will up a giant hand – or anything he can dream up or will into being – and then slap you with it. But if he has a hangover, or he's half-dead or something, the hand'll be all blurry and soft and useless.

This will give him plenty of time to amend the criteria which presently sees no reason in principle why nuclear power plants shouldn't be built on flood plains. Documents quietly released last month establish that susceptibility to flooding is not a deal breaker in the criteria. Areas vulnerable to storm surges aren't ruled out either. And we know from recent experience how well we cope with floods. Some say the criteria now in place bear the imprimatur of Homer Simpson, doyen of Springfield nuclear industry, which seems far-fetched.

Alasdair Buchan, a good friend of this Diary, enjoyed the plot as much as the rest of us but still he was at a loss to explain why his company's books would not tally, especially as it was always his practise to pay everything owing on the credit card in full every month. The issue needed investigating. He was just the man to do it, and soon he sourced the problem to HSBC, discovering that the bank charged him £0.01p interest in March. Now HSBC balked at being told it was a salami- slicer - doesn't look good - but eventually it blamed a \"technical problem\". \"It's a leap year and the computer thinks you've paid your balance off a day late,\" the lady said. It wasn't just him, of course. Other accounts were salami-sliced too but HSBC won't enlighten us as to exactly how many. \"A tiny percentage,\" a spokeswoman told us. They say it is the world's biggest bank. And little wonder. · It's all heating up over the issue of gay clergy, with poor Gene Robinson, the Bishop of New Hampshire's Episcopalian Church, heckled while preaching his sermon in west London.

They can harm anybody who is against them. Some of them are killers. They want to close the mouth of anybody who is against them.\" This gay fatwa comes as news to everyone else but then he is a man of vision. He sees the things we miss. · Here's a surprise. Marc Wadsworth, the \"citizen journalist\" who suckered Boris's now exiled deputy chief of staff into saying Caribbeans disgruntled with their new mayor should repatriate, is keen to have a face-to-face interview with London's top man. And according to his website the-latest.com, Boris's people aren't letting their man anywhere near him. He's scheduled for interviews with black community papers and journals for gays and lesbians, but the list is long and Wadsworth has been warned that he \"is not high on this list\". Public enemy No1 and proud of it. · But how can one worry when life is so good.

For some of us, this has long been a bit of a no-brainer. How could it ever have made sense to wish away our only substantial source of virtually carbon-free electricity at exactly the moment in history when every propeller needs to be turning in order to deliver precisely that outcome? Was our greatest environmentalist, James Lovelock, not always right when he said that whatever the problems of nuclear power, they are as nothing compared to the problems created by global warming? But even though the argument has been won within government circles, there is still no way that Hutton can guarantee the outcomes that he desires. The halcyon days when Anthony Wedgwood Benn, as we knew him then, signed a piece of paper and nuclear power stations were built with taxpayers' money, is long gone. We now have a competitive electricity market - and that applies as much to generation as to supply. Companies will only build nuclear power stations if they are convinced it will make business sense. So when Hutton looks forward to the nuclear share of our power output increasing to 30% within the next couple of decades - which would require at least 12 new reactors - he is expressing a hope rather than a commitment; for it is not within his power to give a commitment. All he can do is seek to persuade potential investors that there is going to be enough commitment and consistency in government policy to see the project through to its desired conclusion. What will the companies, led by the big continental utilities, be looking for? First and foremost, they will surely want an undertaking that the planning and regulatory systems are going to deliver answers one way or another within a reasonable timescale, rather than turning into three-ring circuses that could drag on for a decade or more. The government is currently putting through a planning bill that will be crucial in determining its credibility on this fundamental concern. Hutton is talking about new stations being operational by 2017, which many will think optimistic. But the absolutely certainty is that it will not happen without major changes to how applications are handled. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate will rightly ensure that nothing that impinges on safety is short-circuited but this should be achieved largely through the generic consideration of reactor designs. What Britain is involved in is still not a \"programme of nuclear new-build\", because no such commitments have been made, but an extremely interesting experiment which will demonstrate whether a diverse energy supply can be achieved in open market conditions. What happens if investment in gas-fired generation continues to pour in, promising to fill our generation gap whatever government might say, while new nuclear is stuck in planning inquiries? Would ministers intervene to safeguard their stated desire for low-carbon diversity? The decision to free up sites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is sensible and welcome. For starters, it greatly improves the prospects for new-build at Sellafield where such an initiative would have overwhelming local support. But it also links, in a way that has not previously happened, the virtuous circle of reprocessing and fuelling the new generation of stations, which is the way these challenges are addressed in France. The NDA, as potential partners in new-build, will be far better placed to meet its existing challenges. I am not clear why anti-civil nuclear power campaigners should doubt this or be sceptical. In fact, it will bring a sensible coherence to the process. What beggars belief is that the very substantial assets held at Sellafield and other sites had effectively been deprived of value running to billions of pounds through the past machinations of these same anti-nuclear forces within government. There is absolutely no reason why the government should not sell its stake in British Energy. It was only acquired in the extreme circumstances created by the temporarily low price of electricity in 2002-03 that took British Energy, because of its high fixed costs, to the verge of bankruptcy. These conditions have long since passed and it makes sense to revert to the previous ownership norm. One other consideration should not be overlooked in the rush to accept - from whatever standpoint - the government's assurance that is now committed to a new generation of nuclear stations. Like Britain's nuclear reactors, our nuclear engineers and scientists are an upward age curve. Only small numbers are currently graduating in the UK and the same is true worldwide. This need not be seen as a problem but as a major opportunity for our universities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2008/mar/22/nuclearpower.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-03-22T02:19:08Z","webTitle":"Dawn of a new nuclear age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/22/nuclearpower.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/mar/22/nuclearpower.energy","fields":{"headline":"Dawn of a new nuclear age","bodyText":"A union-sponsored conference on the future of the nuclear industry might once have attracted a few dedicated insiders and PR managers, perhaps to one of the miserably utilitarian buildings around Sellafield. But a meeting on Wednesday organised by Unite will see presentations by the business secretary, John Hutton, British Energy's chief executive, Bill Coley, and a host of other senior industry figures to a packed room of more than 150 delegates. And it will take place at the incongruously glamorous location of the Bafta film and television headquarters in London's West End. Bullish statements from the government over recent weeks about the desirability of building a new generation of atomic power stations - and perhaps even more than before - has caused its own nuclear reaction. The revelation that Britain is to collaborate with France - which generates 79% of its electricity from nuclear stations - on future projects reinforces the sense that Britain is about to enter a new nuclear age. British Energy, the country's biggest reactor operator, announced last Monday that it had become the target of a potential £7bn takeover bid, and all the UK's top gas and electricity suppliers are jostling to get into what could be the next boom market. The following day the Health &amp; Safety Executive and the Environment Agency put out a joint statement that they had provisionally reviewed four potential new nuclear plant designs likely to be used in any newbuilds and could find no fault with them. \"It's just like the late 50s and 60s when nuclear was being promoted as a source of free energy,\" said John Large, a nuclear industry consultant. \"Now it is being heralded as something to save the world.\" Only a few years ago nuclear looked dead on its feet. British Energy had to be rescued by the government after a slump in electricity prices and the industry was under attack from environmentalists for being allegedly unsafe, inefficient and a danger to the planet. Ministers seemed incapable of deciding what to do about the twin perils of climate change and energy security, as North Sea supplies of oil and gas ran out, while the first generation of nuclear power stations came to the end of their natural lives. Some assumed that Britain could muddle through with a mixture of wind power, cleaner coal plants and a great dollop of imported but relatively clean gas. But with the renewable power sector struggling to meet its potential, that strategy was fatally undermined in January 2006 when Russia showed it was willing to use energy as a political weapon by cutting off gas to Ukraine. Accelerated Tony Blair, then prime minister, made it clear that he favoured nuclear at a time when key critics of the industry, such as Margaret Beckett and Michael Meacher, began to leave government. Under Gordon Brown and his business secretary, the pace has accelerated and in recent weeks has turned into a rush. On March 5, Hutton, whose constituency is close to Sellafield, made it clear that the government would pull out all the stops to maximise the expansion of nuclear power. \"We need the maximum contribution from nuclear sources in the next 10 to 15 years,\" he explained. Asked if the government wanted the share of electricity generated from nuclear to rise beyond the current 19%, he replied: \"That's the ambition we should have ... I'd be very disappointed if it's not significantly above the current level.\" The business secretary also made it public that he was interested in selling off the 35% stake that the government had held in British Energy since the financial rescue of the group. Its sites at Sizewell in Suffolk, Dungeness in Kent and Bradwell in Essex - in the south of England, close to the big centres of power demand - are considered the best for building a new generation of plants and the investment bank UBS had already approached the major gas and electricity suppliers on behalf of ministers to see whether they would be interested in buying the public stake. Offer Many are interested, including RWE and E.ON in Germany, EDF in France and Centrica, the owner of British Gas and Scottish &amp; Southern, although none is willing to confirm this publicly. What was made public on Monday was a statement from British Energy that it was in talks that could lead to an offer for the group. Shares in BE rose 20% at one stage after the company said: \"The board announces that the company is in discussions with interested parties in the context of its future and its plans to take a pivotal role in any new nuclear programme.\" It added: \"There can be no certainty that any offer will be made.\" Sources close to the company said there was more than one potential bidder but no immediate takeover was likely. It is also clear that companies such as Centrica are partly motivated by a desire to ensure that BE does not fall into the hands of a major foreign operator that could use British nuclear generation as a platform for tying up the newbuild market in the UK. Amid talk about a skills crisis in a nuclear industry with an ageing workforce, there are also signs of renaissance. Paul Norman, head of physics and nuclear reactor technology at Birmingham University, says he now has 36 students on a special masters course, almost twice as many as the course has had in any of its 51 years, \"and I expect even more next year\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2009/jul/21/transport-transport","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-21T18:00:39Z","webTitle":"London to Cardiff rail line will be electrified to cut carbon footprint","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/21/transport-transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2009/jul/21/transport-transport","fields":{"headline":"London to Cardiff rail line will be electrified to cut carbon footprint","bodyText":"One of Britain's busiest rail lines is to be electrified in a move that will introduce greener and more reliable services for millions of passengers. The government is finalising plans to transform the Great Western mainline as part of a drive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from transport. The programme will involve installing hundreds of miles of electric cables as well as alterations to tunnels, bridges and stations on one of Britain's oldest rail routes. An announcement could come as soon as Thursday, although the financing is still being put in place. The Department for Transport (DfT) and Network Rail, owner of Britain's rail infrastructure, have discussed electrifying the route from London Paddington to Cardiff, taking in Reading and Bristol, as well as the popular commuter route from London to Oxford. However, the programme is expected to be carried out in phases over the next decade in order to minimise disruption. Britain lags behind many of its European counterparts in electrical coverage of its rail system, with only 40% of the 20,000-mile network electrified. Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, has pledged to electrify swaths of the network, led by Great Western and the Midland mainline from St Pancras to Sheffield, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from transport by 14% by 2020. Train operators said electrification would bring quicker and more reliable services for passengers, as well as giving rail a green edge over car and air travel. Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: \"Electrification brings with it the dual benefits of helping to make rail services more attractive to customers and drawing them away from cars and planes. It also relies on lower-carbon sources of energy.\" First Great Western, the main operator on the Great Western network, carries 84 million passengers a year. According to Network Rail, the diesel trains that travel on the Great Western route emit at least double the carbon dioxide output per mile of an electric train. The government-backed company has also calculated that it will cost £800,000 a track mile just to erect the cabling. Once work on tunnels, bridges and culverts is added in electrifying the 118-mile stretch from London to Bristol could cost £380m, according to Network Rail. It is understood that the DfT and Network Rail have discussed funding the work through an increase in Network Rail's borrowings. Network Rail's debt is underwritten by the state and the government will pay off the interest over a number of decades, minimising the immediate impact on the taxpayer. Stephen Glaister, professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College London, said the benefits of electrifying thousands of miles of railway track would be undermined if trains were not powered by energy produced from low-carbon sources such as nuclear plants or wind farms. Otherwise, electrification would simply increase demand for electricity from coal- and gas-powered plants, he added. \"The government has to clarify where the electricity is coming from. In a world where nuclear power is declining and renewables cannot fill the gap, where else is it going to come from apart from burning more coal and gas?\" Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, said last week: \"Transport accounts for a significant amount of our domestic emissions. Therefore decarbonising this sector has to be front and centre of efforts to meet our obligations and commitments to tackle climate change.\" The government is also encouraging greater production, and acquisition, of electric and hybrid cars as part of its low-carbon policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/apr/29/energy-nuclear-bidding","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-29T19:12:37Z","webTitle":"Nuclear site auction raises £400m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/29/energy-nuclear-bidding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/apr/29/energy-nuclear-bidding","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear site auction raises £400m","bodyText":"The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) has raised almost £400m – far more than it expected – after a seven-week bidding battle ended today between energy companies wanting to buy sites on which to build a generation of atomic power plants. The online auction process for three different plots has been scorned by critics but the NDA said last night it had proved to be a good way to maximise value for the British taxpayer. A consortium of German-owned E.ON and RWE npower has won the opportunity to construct a new plant on 438 acres of land at Wylfa in Anglesey and another on 119 acres at Oldbury in Gloucestershire. EDF of France has obtained 493 acres at Bradwell in Essex, next to land it already owns after taking over British Energy. \"The sale of these three sites is worth up to £387m which the NDA will use to help fund the cost of decommissioning and further its core mission,\" said Richard Waite, the acting chief executive of the NDA. The authority said it would begin to dispose of land under its ownership at Sellafield in Cumbria \"as soon as practicable\". Paul Golby, chief executive of E.ON UK, said the result was \"excellent news\" but warned it was \"vital that we as a country build new nuclear power stations to generate alongside cleaner fossil fuels and renewables to ensure security of supply while also reducing carbon emissions.\" EDF reiterated its determination to build four new European Pressurised Reactors in the UK with the first to be operational by the end of 2017. It has bought land at Bradwell but sold land it owned at Wylfa while retaining interest in constructing plants at Sizewell in Suffolk and Hinkley Point in Somerset. The government started the auctioning of the three sites in March and put a floor price of £35m on each site. RWE is still interested in constructing a plant at Kirkstanton in Cumbria, despite local opposition as the plan involves the potential dismantling of a wind farm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/aug/11/taiwan-mudslides-typhoon-morakot","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-11T18:24:14Z","webTitle":"Search continues as 700 feared dead in Taiwan typhoon mudslide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/11/taiwan-mudslides-typhoon-morakot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/aug/11/taiwan-mudslides-typhoon-morakot","fields":{"headline":"Search continues as 700 feared dead in Taiwan typhoon mudslide","bodyText":"The first witness accounts of the terrifying moment when a mudslide buried a Taiwanese village have emerged, as rescuers warned that more than 700 people were trapped and had possibly died in the incident caused by typhoon Morakot. Helicopters have plucked about 300 people from mountainous Kaohsiung county, in the south of the island, but rescuers are still struggling to reach survivors as rain continues. One helicopter crashed into a mountain in nearby Pingtung county with three crew members on board. One villager told Taiwan's China Times newspaper that she fled with her husband and baby minutes before their home was buried. \"We heard two loud bangs ... The sky was filled with dust like a volcanic eruption, and flood waters, mud and rocks streamed onto the roads,\" she said. In China, the government warned of the potential for secondary disasters as heavy rain persisted in the south and 20 rivers hit flood alarm levels. More than 100 people across the Asia-Pacific region, including 62 in Taiwan, have been confirmed dead since the typhoon hit the Philippines, Taiwan and China and tropical storm Etau pummelled Japan, where it claimed 13 lives. The storms have caused hundreds of millions of pounds of damage. Hu Jui-chou, a Taiwanese army major-general involved in rescue operations, said the 700 or more still trapped included residents trapped by a massive landslide in Hsiao-lin and a second village, Namahsia, in Kaohsiung. \"Trapped means they could be dead or alive,\" Hu said by telephone. \"It very likely covers people buried in the Hsiao-lin mudslide.\" Lee Chin-long, 50, told Associated Press he watched as walls of mud and rock wiped out most of the village. \"I was watching from my house upstairs. The whole mountain just fell off. When I saw that, I started to run,\" said Lee, from Cishan, the hub of rescue operations. \"Almost every house was gone, except for a couple.\" One rescued resident, Lin Mei-ying, begged the military to step up efforts, telling the television station ETTV: \"There are still a lot of people trapped inside ... please go faster so they can be saved.\" According to Taiwanese television reports, a mudslide may have buried another village in Pingtung county. Local media also suggested ten other villages may have been seriously damaged, but poor communications and the destruction of roads and bridges is making it hard to assess the scale of the problems. Earlier today Taiwan's fire service reported that tens of thousands were stranded. Footage showed the streets of a village near Hsiao-lin covered by thick mud and rubble. According to reports, a 51-year-old man was swept 1.2 miles (2km) as the mudslides rushed down a nearby mountain, surviving by holding onto a log. It is thought the typhoon hit at around 6am local time, as many householders were sleeping. One survivor told police his family of 10 had been wiped out, the Associated Press reported. \"They are gone,\" he said, according to a local photographer who overheard the exchange. In China, Morakot destroyed 10,000 homes and caused an estimated 9.7bn yuan (£860m) of damage, state media said. The finance ministry offered 102m yuan (£9m) in emergency aid. Hui Liangyu, the vice-president, warned that big floods were still likely as heavy rain continued and more than 20 rivers reported water levels above flood-alarm lines in Zhejiang, Fujian and Anhui provinces, although Morakot has now been downgraded to a tropical storm. In Japan, Etau approached the island's central area and Tokyo, hours after a 6.5 magnitude earthquake tossed food and bottles from store shelves, disrupted transport and shut down a nuclear power plant for safety checks. Japan's weather agency warned of possible landslides and flooding, as the quake followed heavy rain. Footage showed one motorway partially washed out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/oct/26/turkey-iran1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-26T00:05:06Z","webTitle":"'Iran is our friend,' says Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/26/turkey-iran1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/oct/26/turkey-iran1","fields":{"headline":"'Iran is our friend,' says Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan","bodyText":"With its stunning vistas and former Ottoman palaces, the banks of the Bosphorus – the strategic waterway that cuts Istanbul in half and divides Europe from Asia – may be the perfect place to distinguish friend from foe and establish where your country's interests lie. And sitting in his grandiose headquarters beside the strait, long the symbol of Turkey's supposed role as bridge between east and west, Recep Tayyip Erdogan had little doubt about who was a friend and who wasn't. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's radical president whose fiery rhetoric has made him a bête noire of the west? \"There is no doubt he is our friend,\" said Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister for the last six years. \"As a friend so far we have very good relations and have had no difficulty at all.\" What about Nicolas Sarkozy, president of France, who has led European opposition to Turkey's bid to join the EU and, coincidentally, adopted a belligerent tone towards Iran's nuclear programme? Not a friend? \"Among leaders in Europe there are those who have prejudices against Turkey, like France and Germany. Previously under Mr Chirac, we had excellent relations [with France] and he was very positive towards Turkey. But during the time of Mr Sarkozy, this is not the case. It is an unfair attitude. The European Union is violating its own rules. \"Being in the European Union we would be building bridges between the 1.5bn people of Muslim world to the non-Muslim world. They have to see this. If they ignore it, it brings weakness to the EU.\" Friendly towards a religious theocratic Iran, covetous and increasingly resentful of a secular but maddeningly dismissive Europe: it seems the perfect summary of Turkey's east-west dichotomy. Erdogan's partiality towards Ahmadinejad may surprise some in the west who see Turkey as a western-oriented democracy firmly grounded inside Nato. It has been a member of the alliance since 1952. It will be less surprising to Erdogan's secular domestic critics, who believe the prime minister's heart lies in the east and have long suspected his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development party (AKP) government of plotting to transform Turkey into a religious state resembling Iran. Erdogan vigorously denies the latter charge, but to his critics he and Ahmadinejad are birds of a feather: devout religious conservatives from humble backgrounds who court popular support by talking the language of the street. After Ahmadinejad's disputed presidential election in June, Erdogan and his ally, the Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, were among the first foreign leaders to make congratulatory phone calls, ignoring the mass demonstrations and concerns of western leaders over the result's legitimacy. Talking to the Guardian, Erdogan called the move a \"necessity of bilateral relations\". \"Mr Ahmadinejad was declared to be the winner, not officially, but with a large vote difference, and since he is someone we have met before, we called to congratulate him,\" he said. \"Later it was officially declared that he was elected, he got a vote of confidence and we pay special attention to something like this. It is a basic principle of our foreign policy.\" The gesture will be remembered when Erdogan arrives in Tehran this week for talks with Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, that will focus on commercial ties, including Turkey's need for Iranian natural gas. Ahmadinejad has voiced his admiration for Erdogan, praising Turkey's recent decision to ban Israel from a planned Nato manoeuvre in protest at last winter's bombardment of Gaza. Since the election, Iran has witnessed a fierce crackdown on opposition figures that has resulted in activists, students and journalists being imprisoned and publicly tried. Detainees have died in prison, and there have been allegations of torture and rape. Some of those alleging mistreatment have sought refuge in Turkey. But Erdogan said he would not raise the post-election crackdown with his hosts, saying it would represent \"interference\" in Iranian domestic affairs. He poured cold water on western accusations that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon, saying: \"Iran does not accept it is building a weapon. They are working on nuclear power for the purposes of energy only.\" Erdogan has overseen a dramatic improvement in the previously frigid relations between Turkey and Iran, which was viewed with suspicion by the pro-secularist high command of the powerful Turkish military. Trade between the two countries last year was worth an estimated £5.5bn as Iran has developed into a major market for Turkish exports. Erdogan's views will interest US foreign policy makers, who have long seen his AKP government as a model of a pro-western \"moderate Islam\" that could be adopted in other Muslim countries. They will also find an audience with President Barack Obama, who signalled Turkey's strategic importance in a visit last April and has invited the prime minister to visit Washington. They are unlikely to impress Israel, which has warned that Erdogan's criticisms risk harming Turkey's relations with the US. Erdogan dismissed the notion, saying: \"I don't think there is any possibility of that. America's policy in this region is not dictated by Israel.\" He insisted that the Turkey-Israel strategic alliance – which some AKP insiders have said privately is over – remains alive but chided the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who he said had threatened to use nuclear weapons against Gaza."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/aug/28/iran-nuclear-programme-united-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-28T20:55:34Z","webTitle":"Iran is continuing nuclear activity, says United Nations watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/28/iran-nuclear-programme-united-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/aug/28/iran-nuclear-programme-united-nations","fields":{"headline":"Iran is continuing nuclear activity, says United Nations watchdog","bodyText":"The UN's nuclear watchdog reported today that Iran was continuing its uranium enrichment programme in defiance of UN security council resolutions, setting the stage for possible oil and gas sanctions by the west. In a report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also repeated its regular complaint that Iran was not co-operating with its inspectors over unanswered questions about evidence of efforts to militarise the programme and produce a warhead. In his last report on Iran before leaving his post, the IAEA director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the evidence pointing at military aspects of Iran's programme \"appears to have been derived from multiple sources over different periods of time, appears to be generally consistent, and is sufficiently comprehensive and detailed that it needs to be addressed by Iran with a view to removing the doubts which naturally arise about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.\" The report said the number of centrifuges installed at the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz had grown by about 1,000 in the last two months, to 8,000. Over the same period there was a slight drop in the number of those centrifuges being used to enrich uranium. The rest are spinning empty or have just been installed. UN officials said it was the first time in three years the number of active centrifuges had declined. It was not clear whether this was intended as a gesture to international opinion or the result of technical problems. A UN official said: \"We prefer not to speculate.\" Despite having fewer centrifuges being used for enrichment, the output of the Natanz plant appears to be fairly steady at 2.77kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) a day. Iran now has accumulated 1,508kg of LEU. LEU is used in nuclear power reactors rather than weapons, but Iran's western critics argue it can be converted relatively easily into weapons-grade high enriched uranium. Iran now has enough, if that was done, to make a single nuclear warhead. Therefore, Iran's critics are unlikely to see the drop in the number of functioning centrifuges as an Iranian concession. They have also rejected two other recent Iranian gestures – allowing IAEA inspectors to see a heavy water plant under construction in Arak and agreeing to improve monitoring at Natanz – as ploys aimed at defusing international pressure. The IAEA report comes at a critical time, just over three weeks before a UN summit meeting, which has become a de facto deadline for Iran to respond to an international package of incentives to suspend uranium enrichment. The Iranian government has said it will issue a response, but has also said it will not negotiate on enrichment, which it insists is its sovereign right. If there are no signs of compromise from Tehran then the US, Britain and France will lead a campaign to impose new sanctions, probably focused on Iran's energy sector. If they fail to win support from Russia and China at the UN, they will seek to build as much international support as they can. The possible targets of new sanctions are Iran's dependence, despite being an oil-rich state, on foreign supplies of refined petroleum, and its need for technology and equipment to update its oil and gas production and export capacity. However, there are concerns among European and US officials that such measures, aimed at the heart of the Iranian economy, could rally the country around the leadership in the wake of President Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election, and are likely to break the fragile international consensus on dealing with Tehran. As international tensions mounted in the run up to the IAEA report, ElBaradei came under intense pressure over its content and presentation. There were even leaked reports that he was holding back evidence against Iran. Today, the IAEA issued a rare rebuke over those leaks alongside the report. \"Regrettably, time and again unidentified sources feed the media and member states with misinformation or misinterpretation,\" an agency spokesman, Marc Vidricaire, said. \"This time around, there are articles claiming that the secretariat is hiding information, and that there are sharp disagreements among staff members involved about the contents of the report. Needless to say, such allegations have no basis in fact.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/apr/28/economy-ill-wind-green-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-28T15:17:59Z","webTitle":"Economy blows ill wind for renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/28/economy-ill-wind-green-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/apr/28/economy-ill-wind-green-energy","fields":{"headline":"Economy blows ill wind for renewable energy","bodyText":"This year has not been a good one for renewable energy, despite promises by politicians all round the globe to make it the centrepoint of economic recovery. Vestas chief executive Ditlev Engel began 2009 by warning that the economic downturn had left it with a 15% excess in global manufacturing capacity – though he was optimistic about Gordon Brown's promises to create thousands of new jobs in Britain and China's pledge to invest $70bn (£58bn) on electricity grid connections. A year-long study for the department for energy and climate change worked out that another 5,000-7,000 wind turbines could be built off the coast of Britain by 2020, generating 25GW of energy, equivalent to 25 large coal-fired power stations. The new capacity would be on top of 8GW already being built or in planning, making a total of 33GW. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, however, were already warning that \"the most important theme in 2009 within the alternative energy space will be a move from severe under-supply to one of at least a more balanced market and potentially serious oversupply.\" The first big hurdle for wind cropped up in March, with oil company Shell pulling out of wind, solar and hydro power because it felt they were not economic. It said it would concentrate instead on cleaner ways of using fossil fuels, such as carbon capture and sequestration technology. BP cut 620 jobs at its solar division, Siemens cut 400 jobs from its wind operations in Denmark and Iberdrola, owner of ScottishPower, cut investment in renewables by almost half so far this year. A month later, developers of the London Array, a project to build the world's largest offshore wind farm in the Thames estuary, approached the European Investment Bank for a bailout, putting the future of the project in doubt. This week the Guardian revealed that one of the country's most efficient wind farms, at Haverigg in Cumbria, could be dismantled to make way for a new nuclear power station."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/mar/17/diary-hugh-muir","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-17T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary: 17 March 2009","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/17/diary-hugh-muir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/mar/17/diary-hugh-muir","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"As the Eurosceptic Tories get a wigging from the president of the European commission, along comes yet another group of freedom fighters, shaking yet more fists towards Brussels.

The idea is start small, think big; and with that in mind we should not be surprised that few of Sir Paul's old colleagues at Westminster seemed to know anything about yesterday's launch. Why, he didn't even tell his MP, Peter Luff, that he was setting up a new party. That's just rude: Judge is president of Luff's local Conservative Association in Worcester. So why is Sir Paul doing it? Conservatives are baffled, for, as we see, there is a healthy strain of Euroscepticism within their own party. There always seemed to be enough bile to go around. • Read the headlines. \"Home Office gave illegal instructions to immigration officials\" is one. \"MI5 criticised for role in case of torture, rendition and secrecy\" - there's another.

Staff, we learn, will benefit from a \"Home Office Masterclass: Joshua Rozenberg on law\" on the basis that the former BBC correspondent turned all-round legal pundit \"has had a ringside seat at the majority of the department's most significant cases\". \"What is the perception of the Home Office through legal eyes?\" will be a key topic. Hope he doesn't make them cry. • With Gordon setting out his stall on nuclear power today, what more do we know of Justine Thornton, the lawyer for power company E.ON who shares a home and a life with climate change secretary Ed Miliband? Could this Justine Thornton be the same person who manoeuvred herself to become co-ordinator of the energy group for Sera, Labour's environmental campaign? The one who at the Sera AGM in 2007 argued in favour of David Miliband becoming president, despite the fact he was rampantly pro-nuclear power, a policy diametrically opposite to Sera's policy against nuclear energy for the preceding 25 years? If she declared an interest at the time, no one remembers it; perhaps she didn't have to. But the tussle and its outcome certainly led to members tendering their resignations. No doubt it still raises a smile at home. • No surprise that a few weeks into the job, Sir Paul Stephenson, Britain's top cop, should seek to reshuffle the pack. Each new man has new ideas, different priorities. He's smart too. For by moving deputy assistant commissioner Stephen Roberts from a senior berth in HR to a backroom role, developing the apparently crucial relationship between Oxford University and the Met, the commissioner has enhanced the force's links with academia. Sir Ian Blair went to Oxford, remember. These things matter. Sir Paul has also enhanced his own ability to deal with criticism widely expected to form part of the race and faith inquiry commissioned by Boris Johnson. Roberts had become a lightning rod for complaints from black officers that they were failing to gain promotion. Now, when the day arrives, Sir Paul can say he was ahead of the curve. Crisis averted. Roll on the next one. That's the Yard. That's how it works. • And finally, we have travelled through days of horror and hope in Northern Ireland - with the return of murderous terrorism, but also a united response from the various politicians. Many things will result from this. Here is one of them. Last week George Weiss, aka the surrealist Rainbow George, contacted the Electoral Commission and formerly de-registered Make Politicians History, the four-year-old protest party under which banner he fought the 2007 assembly elections in Belfast. \"Having seen the way the politicians there have come together since the attacks, I have come to rather admire them,\" says Rainbow, strangely subdued.

I've seen much worse around London, and you've got to have power, haven't you?\" Reg's reaction is fairly typical of passers-by - although if you were against nuclear power, this is probably the last place you'd be passing by. Sizewell B and its predecessor are situated on a dramatic, otherwise idyllic curve of shingle beach on the Suffolk coast, with rolling dunes, wildflowers and wheeling seabirds. \"It's a beautiful place, as long as you've got your back to the stations,\" says Graham, who regularly walks his dog along the beach. \"But after a while, you just don't notice them. Most people see them as a necessary evil. The power stations employ a lot of people around here.\" Sizewell B, which opened in 1995, is about as fetching as a nuclear power station gets: a corrugated, electric-blue box trimmed with red railings and topped with a brilliant white dome. It's not quite St Paul's, but you might mistake it for a new Ikea, or a modernist mosque - if it wasn't for the big warning signs, earth ramparts, barbed wire, CCTV cameras and regular police patrols. Not to mention the constant hum, audible above the sound of the waves. Beside it is the considerably uglier Sizewell A, a drab, stained industrial carcass from the 1960s that is, mercifully, being decommissioned. On the other side is a vacant, fenced-off plot that will probably become Sizewell C. Like it or not, nuclear days are almost certainly here again, thanks to a combination of climate change, dwindling oil and gas reserves, and dawdling renewable energy policies. Last month, France's EDF Group staged a £12.5bn takeover of British Energy, which operates the UK's eight nuclear power plants. With the government's blessing, EDF has pledged to build at least four more, most likely including one at Sizewell and another at Hinkley Point, Somerset. The political lines on these issues are clearly drawn, but nuclear power stations pose some tricky questions in design terms. For one thing, they must be sited in remote coastal locations, like Sizewell - not just to ensure minimal vaporisation of the population in the event of an accident, but also because stations need access to sea water, the primary coolant in modern designs. As such, most of Britain's nuclear power stations are smack-bang next to nature reserves or national parks, the last places you'd want to find them. It's hard to think of any other type of building that is allowed to occupy such sites, let alone without stringent aesthetic guidelines. Today's architects face a dilemma. Should they play a role in making these facilities look more palatable, or decline to get involved on ethical grounds? Even for pro-nuclear architects, these are not the kind of projects that look good in the portfolio, especially when you're pitching to build, say, a nice green low-energy school. But to avoid the issue could be self-defeating - effectively arguing that they should look ugly, because to make them look nice would be a tacit admission of approval. If we do have to have new nuclear power stations in the landscape, shouldn't we try to make them acceptable aesthetically, even if they're not politically? Our new nuclear custodians have been mindful of this. EDF has already approached a number of British architects, including Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, about possible roles in designing future power stations. Both Foster and Rogers have declined, but a quick survey found several willing candidates. But what exactly could architects do? Nuclear facilities are primarily civil engineering concerns, after all. Only a handful of companies in the world know how to build them. Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs), such as Sizewell B, are theoretically safer than previous designs. Earlier nuclear power stations, such as Sellafield, Chernobyl and Sizewell A, required risky materials: graphite, liquid sodium or carbon dioxide. But PWRs use only water to moderate the nuclear reaction, to transmit the heat and keep the system cool (which is where the sea water comes in). They also have more advanced safety systems and fortress-like layers of concrete around the reactor core (thicknesses have increased even further to withstand possible plane attacks, post-9/11). EDF is currently building the first of its latest PWR design, known as the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR), in Olkiluoto, Finland. It was originally scheduled to start producing electricity in 2009, but the timetable has been pushed back to 2011 because of \"construction deficiencies\". According to some reports, costs have risen by 50% as a result. Amid public protests, work began on another EPR in Flamanville, Normandy, in 2006, where construction has also been delayed. The next EDF reactor is likely to be Sizewell C. How important is the look of these buildings to EDF? \"The first consideration is the technical criteria, because safety is EDF's top priority at all times,\" says a spokesman for the company. \"But aesthetic criteria are taken into account from the beginning of the project. We work with a designer and an architect to think about the effect on the landscape.\" Architect Kevin Lloyd, of the British film John McAslan and Partners, is leading the design of a pair of conventional power stations in east London, for the Olympics site. \"You have to be able to understand how the engineering process works and you have to be able to influence it,\" he says, adding that similar principles apply in nuclear scenarios. \"There's something else we need to bring to these buildings. The qualities you can get out of them through their scale and sculptural qualities, and how they sit as pieces in the landscape - I think those are exciting challenges for architects.\" Will Alsop, another architect whose name has been mentioned in connection with EDF's British nuclear plans, agrees: \"There's more that one can do. They could be, and I think they need to be, rather beautiful things. There's a church on the edge of Vienna by an artist called Wotruba - a huge, raw concrete structure - and I think it's rather beautiful. I don't see why you couldn't do something like that.\" It wasn't long ago that power stations were unquestionably worthy of architectural consideration. One need only look at Battersea and Bankside (home of Tate Modern). Giles Gilbert Scott's 1930s designs elevated those industrial facilities to the same level of civic nobility as churches or town halls - and provided London with two of its best-loved landmarks. The tradition continued into the early nuclear age with the appointment of Basil Spence, architect of Coventry cathedral, to design Trawsfynydd in Wales. Like Scott, Spence went down the route of unabashed monumentality to reflect the awesome technology at work within. Never mind that his 20-storey monoliths in the middle of Snowdonia stuck out like a pair of sore thumbs. At the time of Trawsfynydd's construction, in 1959, this treatment was entirely appropriate: symbolically, nuclear power was one of the few things that told Britain it was still Great. That triumphalism would soon fade, as the implications of the Windscale fire in 1957 became apparent, and environmental and peace movements started to campaign against nuclear. One need only look at the industrial-looking nuclear eyesores built in the 1970s and 80s, such as Hartlepool or Dungeness, to see the change. Having furnished Britain with some of the ugliest buildings ever seen, British Energy took a renewed concern in the appearance of Sizewell B in the 90s. EDF has been doing the same thing in France. According to their spokesman: \"Flamanville 3 is being built at the foot of a cliff, so it is virtually invisible from the land side. And at Chinon [in western France], the height of the cooling tower was modified to make it more sympathetic to the surrounding landscape, which is quite flat.\" But even if the next generation of nuclear architecture reaches new aesthetic heights and provides safe, cheap power for all, it will be by no means the end of the story. Long after they reach the end of their useful lives, nuclear power stations will be hanging around in the landscape. Basil Spence foresaw this back in the 1960s. One of his guiding questions for the design of Trawsfynydd was: \"Will it make a beautiful ruin?\" We're still grappling with the question, and will be for a long time to come. When Trawsfynydd was decommissioned in 1991, the industry was open to offers about what they could do with it. In the 1990s, a BBC TV programme invited proposals from architects and designers. Suggestions included turning it into film studios, or burying it under a mound of rubble. The answer was not straightforward in the way it was with a plant like Bankside: a slightly radioactive Tate Wales, anyone? Work is going on to lower the height of the 170ft-tall buildings by a third, and to clad them in local slate. Designs were drawn up by the engineering firm Arup, but the scheme is unlikely to finish before 2018, since funds for decommissioning are down to a trickle. The reactors inside won't be ready for dismantling until 2088. Meanwhile, the building will just sit there, serving no practical purpose. When you take the very long view, the architecture of nuclear plants will look like a passing concern. Barring advances in technology, our civilisation will still have radioactive waste as a reminder of the current nuclear age thousands of years into the future - long after the names of Basil Spence, or Norman Foster, or EDF are forgotten. 'Any architect helping to promote nuclear may never have a good night's sleep again' Would you design a nuclear power station? No Andrew Morris Senior director, Rogers Stirk Harbour &amp; Partners As far as we're concerned, it is a difficult subject. There is nothing in our constitution that says it is prohibited, strictly speaking, whereas working on defence installations is. We're great believers in developing alternative methods of generating energy, but we also accept that there is a need and a desire for nuclear energy, given the current scenario. We have been approached, and we turned that offer down. I think we would probably do the same again - I don't think our hearts would be in it. No Lord Foster Foster and Partners We built EDF's first green headquarters building in Bordeaux in 1999, and they have asked us to design a nuclear power station. We declined for several reasons, and, as is normal, discussions with our client are confidential. Yes Amanda Levete Director, Future Systems Architects can make a huge contribution to the design of nuclear power stations. The derisory might call it a rebranding exercise. Well, you know what? Whether you like it or not, branding has become a necessary and, dare I say it, meaningful part of our visual culture. Why shouldn't a nuclear power station be a thing of beauty and power, which communicates both optimism and human frailty, and speaks of our time and our future? I'm up for it. Yes Will Alsop Absolutely. I wouldn't think twice. It doesn't go against my principles. I think from both an environmental and a moral point of view, we have to go there. At one stage, in the 1950s and 60s, Britain was a world leader in nuclear power generation, and we let that go to rack and ruin - and now the French have to come in. It's a pity we didn't keep on top of the game, so to speak. No Bill Dunster ZEDfactory We would never design or promote a nuclear power station. The investment in nuclear effectively empties the funding reserves previously allocated to renewable energy sources. Add the enhanced security investment required to stop misuse of radioactive waste, and the dumping of heat as a waste product far from population centres, and the nuclear revival becomes the biggest scam of our times, promoted by vested interests and large engineering consortiums. Any architect helping to promote this technology is entering into a Faustian pact with dark forces, and may never have a good night's sleep again. If we cannot run a stable financial system, what chance is there that we can afford to spend billions for millennia keeping our nuclear legacy from poisoning our groundwater, our seas and agriculture? Yes Chris Wilkinson Director, Wilkinson Eyre I'd be keen to design a nuclear power station. In the short term, they provide the cleanest source of power we have available. In an ideal world, we would be able to harness sufficient geothermal power, windpower, solar power. In reality, this isn't possible now. Yes Kevin Lloyd John McAslan &amp; Partners We've been debating as to whether this is something we'd like to be involved with. I think we would. There is a government agenda and there is a need for these new power stations. If there's an inevitability to it, I think we have an obligation to do the best we can to make them significant pieces of high-quality architecture."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2007/apr/18/energy.business","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-04-18T22:58:29Z","webTitle":"The question: How safe is a floating nuclear power plant?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/apr/18/energy.business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/apr/18/energy.business","fields":{"headline":"How safe is a floating nuclear power plant?","bodyText":"Given that we are already supposed to be facing the twin threats of terrorism and environmental meltdown, you might think the last thing the world needs is a fleet of floating nuclear power plants (NPPs). Russia disagrees, and confirmed this week that construction has started on the first of seven ships carrying a 70MW nuclear reactor. The ships will provide power to remote coastal towns, or be sold abroad, with 12 countries, including Algeria and Indonesia, said to have expressed interest. Following the fallout - diplomatic and radioactive - from the Chernobyl disaster, the Russians anticipated scepticism and dispatched a member of the state Duma's \"ecology committee\" to reassure the world. \"The floating NPPs have five radiation protection barriers and can withstand an earthquake seven to eight points on the Richter scale, 100mph winds and a falling Jak-40 jet,\" said Mikhail Zalikhanov. Another official pointed to the Kursk - the nuclear submarine that sank, killing all its crew, in 2000, yet was salvaged safely - as proof that the Russians know about putting nuclear reactors to sea. Environmentalists, however, are predictably filled with dread. A spokesperson from Greenpeace's \"nuclear team\" says the very idea of these ships is \"bonkers\" and like placing \"Chernobyl on the Titanic\". Just look to the past, they say: \"The history of [Russian nuclear submarines] has seen at least 100 accidents, varying from leakages to melting of active zones and detonations.\" But it's not just the Russians who like to roll the dice of chance. In 2003, New Scientist reported that the US Air Force was contemplating a \"nuclear-powered unmanned aircraft\", to be airborne for months at a time.

Three of Labour's biggest beasts – the prime minister, Lord Mandelson and Ed Miliband – lined up in London on Friday to launch a new wave of offshore wind turbines the government hopes will create up to 70,000 \"green collar\" jobs over the next decade. But as snow brought Britain to a halt, the green dream had little hope of dominating the headlines. Thursday had already brought an unwelcome reminder of the more mundane reality of Britain's energy policy today: almost 100 factories were ordered to shut off their gas supplies, to prevent the prolonged cold snap leaving households in the dark, in what energy experts said was the clearest evidence yet of a looming power crisis. The dire winter weather may have been impossible to predict, but the fact that it forced the National Grid to trigger so-called \"interruptible contracts\" for scores of large firms, underlines just how short supplies already are. \"The whole situation is very, very difficult and we have got to stop pretending we have got anything other than chaos,\" says Andrew Bainbridge of the Major Energy Users' Council. He says some major retailers have reported dips in electricity supplies as the temperatures have plunged, adding to the problems of coping with the cold. Even if the £100bn wind-power revolution hailed by Brown and his colleagues is a stunning success, it will do nothing to alleviate a formidable short-term squeeze, resulting from the fact that many older electricity plants – both nuclear and coal-fired – are due to be scrapped over the next few years, leaving Britain increasingly dependent on gas power, at the same time as its own reserves in the North Sea are being rapidly run down, so that the gas-fired plants will have to be heavily reliant on imported supplies. \"We've got all the nukes and most of the coal going off the system in the next 10 years,\" says Professor Dieter Helm, an expert in the economics of energy at Oxford University. He says without the worst recession in 50 years, which has reduced economic output this year by more than 5%, \"our CO2 emissions would look much worse, and our energy security problems would be pressing\". He describes last week's rationing as \"a little wake-up call\". None of the problems facing the government this winter are new: energy consumers, including many of Britain's biggest businesses, have been warning for years that there is little supply to spare. Even with the interconnector pipeline now bringing gas directly from the continent, a lack of storage capacity means there is no guarantee that Britain's needs will be served, and prices can swing dramatically. There is little indication of how the government hopes to fill the gap between the clunky old plants being mothballed, and the shiny new future of renewables in a decade's time. Labour has announced a new generation of nuclear plants, but few analysts expect them to come on stream in time. The latest electricity generation data, released on Friday, showed that as the temperatures dropped, 45% of output was being produced from coal, 37% from gas, 15% from nuclear power — and just 0.2% from wind. Energy consumers say governments have for decades delayed the costly decisions needed to guarantee a smooth switchover from the old generation of plants to a new, greener era. \"Everybody's blaming the Labour government, but the problem started with the Tories: no government has really grasped the nettle of an energy mix to make sure that we have got secure supplies,\" says Bainbridge. Meanwhile, many analysts fear rationing, like that which took place last week, will become an increasingly common occurrence. Firms voluntarily sign up to interruptible contracts, which give them cheaper bills; but when a blackout is triggered, as it was last week, companies can suddenly be forced to look for supplies elsewhere at short notice, and often at painfully high cost. Steve Radley, head of policy at manufacturers' group the EEF, says: \"It's going to be about the signal that this sends to potential investors in this country, and multinationals that are already here and thinking about whether to make that next investment.\" And, despite Brown and his colleagues' enthusiasm for offshore wind, and the jubilation of the firms, including Centrica and Siemens, that formed the winning consortiums, there are profound doubts among some in the industry about whether it can solve even Britain's longer-term energy challenges. A report prepared by consultants BVG Associates for the Crown Estate, which granted the new round of wind farm licences, highlighted a series of potential problems, from lack of affordable finance to a shortage of skills and to technical problems with servicing installations sited many miles offshore. There are also questions about how much the British economy will benefit. Some regions, including Brown's constituency in Fife, are hoping to see hundreds of jobs created building and servicing the new turbine platforms, using skills developed for the offshore gas industry. But the EEF estimates that 90% of the €2bn being spent on the vast London Array – the largest example of a wind project already under way – has leaked overseas. There is no turbine manufacturing capacity in the UK, after the closure of the Vestas factory on the Isle of Wight — though the government is known to be trying to persuade manufacturers, including Germany's Siemens, to locate a new turbine plant here. Perhaps the biggest doubt about the dash for wind, however, is that it only provides an intermittent power supply, which is hard to store – so some back-up alternative is needed for times when the wind is low. Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users' Group, says: \"Wind is a particularly useless form of power generation if you don't have a way of storing the energy. It just seems the politicians have been taken in by the wind lobby, and they've taken leave of their senses.\" Radley says: \"If you're going for more renewable energy, a lot of it is intermittent, and you need back-up with gas. For the foreseeable future we are going to become more dependent on gas, so it's absolutely vital that we get this right.\" Almost all analysts are agreed that solving the short-term energy crunch, as well as achieving the target of 30% of power produced from renewable sources by 2020, will be expensive. The energy market regulator Ofgem published a review of Britain's future energy requirements last year, which suggested an eye-watering £200bn of investment would be necessary to secure the UK's energy supplies by 2020 and meet its carbon targets. This means that customers could face potential price rises of anywhere between 14% and 60%. Ofgem chief executive Alistair Buchanan said: \"Chief among the challenges this country faces are growing exposure to a volatile global gas market and power stations nearing the end of their life. Early action can avoid hasty and even more expensive measures later.\" But Helm suggests it may be a forlorn hope to expect the government to take radical action upfront to secure supplies. He draws a parallel with financial regulation. For many years, he says, governments simply stood back and expected the market to provide — but collective problems such as making sure the lights don't go out will never be solved by individual firms, which have an incentive to keep prices high. \"Security of supply is a public good: it's a system property; it will not be provided by the market left to its own devices,\" he says. He warns that it could take the energy equivalent of a credit crunch to force politicians to wake up. \"Energy policy never changes in advance of a crisis, it only ever changes after a crisis.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/blog/2008/jan/04/newsdesknotesforfridayjanu","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-04T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Newsdesk notes for Friday January 4","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/jan/04/newsdesknotesforfridayjanu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/blog/2008/jan/04/newsdesknotesforfridayjanu","fields":{"headline":"Newsdesk notes for Friday January 4","bodyText":"Suzanne Goldenberg and Ewen MacAskill join Newsdesk's Francesca Panetta in Iowa, where Barack Obama won for the Democrats and Mike Huckabee for the Republicans in the first real test of voter opinion in the race to be the next US president. • Subscribe free to Newsdesk, via iTunes • or download this to your computer • The Newsdesk podcast feed URL As acting Liberal Democrat leader Vincent Cable led the calls for the government to intervene to protect the public interest in the Northern Rock case.

The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the organisation given the job of decommissioning and cleaning up Britian's civil nuclear sites, is selling land at Bradwell in Essex, Oldbury in Gloucester and Wylfa in Anglesey, close to existing Magnox reactors. Part of the land at Wylfa belongs to EDF, the state-owned French company that is bidding for Britain's nuclear generator, British Energy. The government is keen to see the construction of a new generation of nuclear reactors to replace Britain's ageing stock as part of what it sees as the development of a balanced portfolio of power generation. Sites close to existing nuclear plants are seen as the most likely locations, in part because of existing connections to the National Grid and partly because of the contribution of the existing sites to local economies. The government has said it wants to see more than one company come forward to build the next generation of nuclear power stations and the sale of the sites is seen as opening the door to another player in addition to EDF. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said yesterday: \"We've been clear that we want to see more than one new nuclear operator in the UK and this sale has the potential to make that a reality. The land on offer will be highly attractive to power companies interested in new-build, alongside separate plans from EDF for four reactors on British Energy sites.\" The NDA said yesterday it planned to hold discussions with interested parties, after which it would be open to potential bidders to submit indicative proposals. \"Participants in the process will be given the opportunity to visit the land for sale, evaluate the opportunity and perform due diligence,\" the NDA said in a statement. EDF said it supported the government's objective to have more than one participant in new nuclear power stations in the UK. \"The sites arrangements between EDF and the government announced previously are designed to facilitate the entry of other new nuclear operators in the UK.\" The NDA plans to hold an auction in the first three months of next year but the timetable depends on EDF's bid for British Energy becoming unconditional. The NDA said both it and EDF would be looking to get the best price for the land subject to \"certain conditions\" which, in the case of the NDA, includes the approval of DECC. The existing Oldbury power station is due to close next month and Wylfa in March 2010. Bradwell is already being dismantled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2010/jan/08/northern-ireland-iris-robinson-michael-white","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-08T11:53:52Z","webTitle":"Iris Robinson and Gerry Adams cases: Ulster puritanism caught with its pants down | Michael White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/jan/08/northern-ireland-iris-robinson-michael-white","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2010/jan/08/northern-ireland-iris-robinson-michael-white","fields":{"headline":"Ulster puritanism caught with its pants down","bodyText":"Fond as I am of our battered political class, I prefer not to be reminded that its members possess genital organs, let alone that they succumb to the occasional urge to use them. Today's media is full of sex'n'politics in puritanical Northern Ireland, of all places. What is the world coming to? The striking thing about the DUP MP Iris Robinson's admitted affair with a 19-year-old is that, yes, it's basically a sex story – glamorous Mrs Robinson (59) meets Benjamin, just like in the movie, except that he's not a graduate and his name is Kirk McCambley, the son of a family friend whom she promised to look after when his dad died. The money involved and – much more important – the political ramifications for her husband, Peter Robinson, the DUP first minister in the troubled executive at Stormont, are secondary features of the core story: an ill-judged affair and a suicide bid. All a bit sad really, though – as Fionola Meredith has written on Comment is free, the impulse is tempered among Iris-watchers in the province by her harsher utterances as an evangelical Pentecostal – \"an Ulster Sarah Palin\". There is symmetry here with the sex crisis which hit Sinn Féin before Christmas when Gerry Adams's brother, Liam, went on the run over allegations of child abuse and the Sinn Féin president revealed – I suppose the proper word is \"alleged\" – that their late father, Gerry Sr, had abused family members too. It has political ramifications – of course it does. How much did Gerry Jr know, when did he know it and what did he do about it are questions that have been eagerly aired in Sinn Féin circles and by its enemies on both left and right. Given the IRA's brutal treatment of child molesters, there is a hypocrisy component in the mix here as well. But, as with the Robinsons, there is sadness in the human side of the story that it is heartless to ignore completely. Such secrets, such burdens, on top of everything else. In the wake of last night's BBC Spotlight exposure of both Iris Robinson's affair and the loan she engineered for McCambley, radio reports say Peter Robinson plans to tough it out and hang on, which must be what the government in both London and Dublin are praying that he does. He may just manage it, but it will depend on restraint by both his DUP colleagues and his Sinn Féin opponents/partners in the Stormont regime – neither especially famous for restraint and both notoriously puritanical, the sort of people who use the \"fur coat and no knickers\" jibe about their less moral opponents. Well, what goes round comes round again, and websites such as the redoubtable Slugger O'Toole are having a field day. Yet, so far as I can see, the public dimension of the controversy is not fundamentally about financial corruption, either. The £50,000 Mrs Robinson persuaded two businessmen to provide so that her protege could renovate a Lagan riverside listed building, council-owned, as a cafe was not public money. And the saga was about sex, not money. That separates it out from the £500,000 a year that, Belfast reporters estimate, the Robinsons get as pay and expenses in their various elected offices – Stormont, Westminster, etc – plus the £140,000 that went to pay family members. Like other politicians on the mainland, they have been caught being greedy. No, the political problem is transparency and accountability in a world which now demands it even in Northern Ireland, as it does for the once untouchable Adams. Mrs Robinson should clearly have declared an interest as a member of Castlereagh council when the cafe lease was agreed: she's in trouble for that, and for other transgressions. She is apparently not well, and is stepping down from public life. In a statement earlier this week, her husband, always a cold fish in public terms, confirmed that he was standing by her in surprisingly emotional terms. We'll see how it pans out. But the big picture issue is the fate of the Northern Ireland executive and assembly, which have not functioned properly for months because of deepening mistrust and deadlock over SF's desire to get control of police and justice back from the UK government. That's a wish its DUP rivals resist, not least because the Real and Continuity IRA are making a renewed assault on the peace process. There was another bomb this morning. Peter Robinson is central to that. If he is forced to resign, the joint office he shares with Martin McGuinness closes, the executive and assembly fold too – \"like a pack of cards,\" a Belfast chum told me. Adams's problems with his brother are less constitutionally acute because McGuinness, not he, is the man in government. But he is weakened in his own community, as is Peter Robinson, both at a dangerous time. According to the BBC's revelations, Robinson's problem seems to be that, when he discovered the facts of his wife's affair and financial dealings, he told her to pay the money back – but he didn't shop her to the authorities. Nor did he register his own conflict of interest as an MP, first minister etc. If an inquiry is ordered – and it will be, I imagine – should he be suspended, suspend himself, or merely absent himself from the process? Adams and McGuinness are pressing for progress on police and justice, and pressing Robinson for answers on his own problems, but face pressure from militants and ordinary Catholic voters on their own side. As we discussed here recently, Robinson is under pressure from breakaway ex-colleagues led by Jim Allister and the Traditional Ulster Voice (TUV). There is an unavoidable UK general election looming, which may see the DUP further weakened, outflanked on the right politically as SF/IRA is by their own republican dissidents. So far, Robinson's DUP colleagues are standing by him. These are questions being hammered out against the wider background of crisis. The once dynamic Celtic tiger is now a crippled economy on the fringe of the eurozone, biting the financial bullet, as fellow victims Greece and Spain are not yet doing, but at great cost. Britain has its mighty problems, too. But it is so much bigger and, unlike Britain, Ireland can no longer devalue its currency to ease the strain of retrenchment and recession. The pain must be extracted elsewhere in jobs, services and pay. Tricky, isn't it? It should have been expected that gradual normalisation of Northern Irish politics would throw up some scandals, just as greater transparency does in most fields – the cost of nuclear power, for instance. Repressed and puritanical traditions have their dark secrets even as they preach damnation against the wicked outside world, which does not feel such a need to hide brazen conduct. The timing is awful, but there may be comfort in the thought that there is now a puritanical Irish Protestant scandal to match the fall from grace of the puritanical SF/IRA – and behind it the Irish Catholic hierarchy reeling from resignations over past lack of accountability. It is a joke the late Brendan Behan would have relished. He wrote very funny plays about such people when Adams and Robinson were still in short trousers. As for what Joe Orton might have made of it all, it does not bear contemplation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2010/feb/07/the-pinch-david-willetts","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-07T00:07:47Z","webTitle":"The Pinch: How the Baby Boomers Stole Their Children's Future by David Willetts | Book review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/07/the-pinch-david-willetts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2010/feb/07/the-pinch-david-willetts","fields":{"headline":"The Pinch: How the Baby Boomers Stole Their Children's Future by David Willetts","bodyText":"David Willetts is a rare creature. Britain does not produce many public intellectuals. To find one lurking deep in the jungle of Westminster politics is little short of an anthropological miracle. But with this book, Willetts, a frontline Conservative politician, has confirmed his status as the thinking person's MP. The Pinch sets out to show how the baby boomers – those, like Willetts, who were born between 1945 and 1965 – have \"stolen their children's future\" through their cultural, demographic and political dominance. Willetts does not quite succeed in proving this charge of intergenerational theft. But in marshalling his case he takes you on such a fascinating journey through British society that you do not feel remotely shortchanged. His stated thesis is that the big generation of boomers has concentrated wealth, adopted a hegemonic position over national culture and failed to attend to the needs of the future. They have, in effect, broken the inter-generational contract. It is certainly true that the boomers have done well out of the welfare state, being set to take out, Willetts suggests, approximately 118% of what they'll put in. But this makes them no worse than previous generations, including those born between 1900 and 1920. There is also no doubt that the monomaniacal British obsession with home ownership, while far from being a new phenomenon, has so far benefited the boomers rather more than the generations on either side. At the same time, the rise in immigration since the mid-1990s has held down wages for Generations X and Y (or those born between the mid-60s and the millennium) who would otherwise be benefiting from being in a smaller cohort and therefore a tighter labour market. It is also true that the boomers haven't been proactive enough on climate change – indeed, Willetts says too little about this – but it is hard to argue that they can be singled out on these grounds. Willetts is unsure whether the boomers are a bad generation or just a big and lucky one. At one point, he insists that \"generational name-calling\" is unhelpful and that the issue at hand is simply a demographic one. But at other points, he labels the boomer generation a \"selfish giant\", which sounds like name-calling to me. The main problem facing him is the absence of hard data. There is good academic research in the US on \"inter-generational accounting\", but no equivalent here. Willetts is candid about the fact that \"there are no authoritative estimates of the distribution of the £6.7 trillion of wealth in our country between the different age groups\" and relies instead on the assertion that \"there are good reasons to believe\" the boomers have got more than their fair share. There are some reasons to believe this, but it is also likely that the recent financial crash will alter any generational distribution of money, since the boomers are retiring just as the value of their pension assets has been sharply knocked down. Willetts might have done better to take as his main theme the links between family, education and social mobility, since on these issues he is on firmer ground. In fact, his title could just as easily have been The Big Grab: How the Rich Are Using Money and Marriage to Buy the Future for Their Kids. His opening chapter is a tour de force, a brief, brilliant history of England's social architecture. He shows that far from being a modern invention, the nuclear family is a long-standing feature of Anglophone societies. (We are, he says, \"the first nuclear power\".) The idea that we used to live in big, warm, noisy My Big Fat Greek Wedding-type families is a myth. \"Think of England as being like this for at least 750 years,\" he writes. \"We live in small families. We buy and sell houses. We go out to work for a wage.\" The English have a private, market-based idea of property, in contrast to the familial property forms of our continental neighbours. Over a 44-year period in Leighton Buzzard, more than 900 houses changed hands. Two-thirds were sold to someone outside the family, rather than being passed down. The years in question? 1464 to 1508. By contrast, the large familial networks of continental Europe act as the institutional anchor for property ownership and transmission, as well as for the formation of businesses and the provision of welfare. Willetts speculates that the property-managing function of French families may explain why romantic love there is more often associated with extramarital relationships. The orientation towards family-owned firms in Germany helps to explain the strength of the Mittelstand, the medium-sized, locally rooted layers of corporations. Willetts does not at any point fall victim to the awful if-only-we-were-more-like-the-continentals lament. He does not want to alter our social DNA. But our particular social economy has two important consequences. First, the smallness of our families puts a greater emphasis on non-familial civic institutions. Small families need civil society more. This is why medieval guilds, trade unions and churches have played such an important role in our history. Second, the welfare role of government is greater in a society marked by a highly privatised notion of property and small families. Breadwinning men are less likely to have family resources to fall back on, so need out-of-work benefits. This system worked reasonably well until the rise in divorce rates in 1970s and 1980s. Then, millions of women, many with dependent children, suddenly became reliant on the state. As Willetts puts it: \"A welfare system that was originally designed to compensate men for loss of earnings is slowly and messily redesigned to compensate women for the loss of men.\" And everybody – but especially women – ends up poorer. This is why Willetts, certainly no reactionary, is so pro-marriage. Strong parental relationships also influence children's well-being, which in turn affects the chances of upward social mobility, another of Willetts's preoccupations. Drawing on the very latest and best research, Willetts shows how the middle classes are tightening their grip on the opportunities available for the next generation. The professions are all but sealed off from the poor: \"The competition for jobs is like English tennis, a competitive game but largely one the middle classes play against each other.\" In general, this is a remarkably non-political book; David Cameron is mentioned just once. But Willetts does argue strongly for a vouchers scheme in education, weighted in favour of the poor, in order to break the middle-class stranglehold on the state education system. And the explanation for the flat-lining of social mobility brings Willetts back to social structures and, in particular, the trade-off between gender equality and class equality. The principal beneficiaries of the expansion of higher education have been the daughters of the middle class. Six per cent of girls born into low-income families in both 1958 and 1970 went to university; for girls born into richer households, the rate rose from 21 per cent to 36 per cent. \"Educational upgrading\" – the increase in the numbers of young people getting qualifications – accounts for 40 per cent of the fall in mobility for women between 1958 and 1970. This is, as Willetts says, a shocking statistic. The expansion of higher education, far from improving social mobility, has actually made it worse. Women graduates marry male graduates and this trend towards \"assortative mating\" has increased in recent years, which means that on a household level, inequality is bound to rise. The narrowing of the gender gap seems to have widened the class gap. As Willetts puts it: \"Feminism has trumped egalitarianism.\" And not just for one generation, either: just 5% of degree-educated mothers split up from their partner before their child's third birthday, compared with 42% of mums with no qualifications. Willetts manages to synthesise these social trends into a coherent and engaging narrative, successfully mixing vignettes from South Park and The Simpsons with statistics from the British Household Panel Survey. Most important, when it comes to social and economic research, Willetts really does know his stuff. David Cameron has lately been engaging fruitfully with external political thinktanks (including, I should say, Demos). This is greatly to his credit. Let's hope he recognises that in David Willetts he has a one-man thinktank right under his nose. Richard Reeves is the director of Demos"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2008/may/29/economy.tax","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-28T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Chancellor ready to postpone 2p increase in fuel duty again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/29/economy.tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2008/may/29/economy.tax","fields":{"headline":"Chancellor ready to postpone 2p increase in fuel duty again","bodyText":"The 2p rise in fuel duty, due to come into force in October, is likely to be deferred, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, said yesterday as he acknowledged the pressures of rising petrol prices on families and business. In an attempt to clarify the government position on fuel and car taxes, amid reports of a second tax U-turn in less than a month, after that on the 10p rate, Darling said he would make a final decision on the 2p increase by early autumn. \"I intend to come back to the issue of the fuel tax increase that would be due this October,\" he told Radio 4's The World at One. \"I will do that, because I am very conscious of the fact that people are concerned about the amount of money they are now having to pay out every time they have to fill up their car.\" His announcement came as he and Gordon Brown showed their determination to deal with rising oil prices and the importance of improving the security of Britain's energy supplies by making two key announcements. During a meeting with oil industry executives in Banchory, near Aberdeen, the prime minister: · Made clear the government would press ahead with a new generation of nuclear power stations, declaring for the first time that new sites could be found. \"We want to do more to diversify our supply of energy and that's why I think we are pretty clear that we will have to do more than simply replace existing nuclear capability in Britain. We will be more ambitious for our plans for nuclear in the future.\" His remarks echoed those by the business secretary, John Hutton, in March. · Pledged to boost the production of oil by lending the government's support to increasing North Sea exploration. Darling admitted that boosting UK oil production would have a negligible impact on the international price of a barrel. While the two initiatives will have little impact in the medium term, Downing Street hoped to send a clear signal that the prime minister is aware of the impact of rising fuel prices and is taking action. Darling said the government had two priorities: to try to drive down oil prices by joining with other countries to persuade Opec to increase production, and to examine fuel taxes in Britain. There was confusion about the government's plans on fuel and car taxes on Tuesday. Jack Straw, the justice secretary, and John Hutton, the business secretary, gave the impression that there could be movement on the fuel duty and a second measure, the £200 increase in car tax for polluting cars bought since 2001. Downing Street played down the significance of their remarks on Tuesday night when it said no changes were being examined. Darling attempted to clarify the government's intentions by indicating that the fuel duty increase, which was deferred in March's budget, would be postponed again in October. The chancellor would probably review the increase again in next year's budget, a move that would deprive the Treasury of £555m. The chancellor was less forthcoming on the increase in car tax on polluting vehicles. He dismissed criticisms made by Greenpeace that it gave green taxes a bad name because it would apply retrospectively and therefore not achieve the government's stated intention for such taxes: to change people's future behaviour. \"The VED [vehicle excise duty] has been linked to how polluting a car is since the beginning of the decade,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2009/sep/07/airliner-bomb-plot-profiles-defendants","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-07T15:06:37Z","webTitle":"Airliner bomb plot: profiles of the defendants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/07/airliner-bomb-plot-profiles-defendants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2009/sep/07/airliner-bomb-plot-profiles-defendants","fields":{"headline":"Airliner bomb plot: profiles of the defendants","bodyText":"ABDULLA AHMED ALI The 28-year-old, also known as Ahmed Ali Khan, grew up as one of eight children, five of them boys. His parents moved to Britain in the 1960s from Pakistan. In the 1980s the family went back there for six years before returning to east London in 1987. In court in the first trial Ali recalled seeing images of \"concentration camps\" in Bosnia when he was 15 or 16 and being \"aware they were Muslims\". In his \"suicide\" video Ali said that he had aspired to martyrdom since the age of 15 and described himself as the leader of the \"blessed\" operation. He studied computer systems engineering at university where he became actively involved in politics, joining demonstrations and handing out leaflets. After graduation he began volunteering with an Islamic charity in east London. In January 2003 he travelled to a refugee camp for Afghans in Pakistan, where he felt \"emotions that I had not felt before\". Convicted of conspiracy to commit murder at the first trial. This time convicted of conspiracy to blow up airliners. ASSAD SARWAR Sarwar, 29 and married, was said by the prosecution to be the quartermaster of the plot, purchasing and storing bomb-making materials, with terrorist ambitions that were \"limitless\". He was \"too precious\" for the cause so was not intended to die, hence the absence of a \"martyrdom\" recording by him, the court heard. But he claimed he was not involved in a terrorist plot and described al-Qaida as \"deviant\" in court. After dropping out of Brunel University, Sarwar met Ali while doing charity work in Pakistan. They visited refugee camps housing Afghans who had fled the US invasion of their country. He returned to Britain in May 2003 and drifted through two short-term jobs as a postman with Royal Mail and for BT. He said he again met up with Ali, who he described as having \"leading characteristics\", compared to his own \"weak character\", in 2003 and again in 2006 at lectures in east London. In between, Sarwar returned to Pakistan for two months in October 2005 to help survivors of the earthquake in Kashmir. Sarwar said that in 2006 Ali invited him to his flat and they chatted about UK foreign policy before hitting upon the idea of a \"publicity stunt\". But the prosecution alleged he had links with terror chiefs in Pakistan. Sarwar claimed detailed flight lists found on a computer memory stick at his home were just \"holiday destinations in America\". The memory stick also had information on improvised bombs, attacking aircraft, details of the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl and information on British nuclear power stations. Convicted of conspiracy to commit murder at the first trial. This time convicted of conspiracy to blow up airliners. TANVIR HUSSAIN Hussain, 28, from Leyton, east London, was described as a gifted sportsman by Ali. In his \"martyrdom\" video Hussain, a part-time postman, said: \"People are going to die but it's worth the price\". A loyal and enthusiastic participant in the operation, he spent hours with Ali at the Forest Road bomb factory adapting and experimenting with soft drink bottles. It was this evidence that forced him, like Ali and Sarwar, to admit to conspiring to cause explosions. Following several years at college experimenting with drink, drugs and girls, Hussain worked in a sexual health clinic. In 2005 he reinvented himself as a devout Muslim after entering into an arranged marriage. Hussain was caught on a bug discussing popular holiday destinations for British travellers with Ali. The two men applied for fast-track passports after deliberately losing their originals, which contained Pakistani visas. He was followed by surveillance teams as he bought essential items for the plot, including surgical needles and syringes. Convicted of conspiracy to commit murder at the first trial. Now convicted of conspiring to blow up airliners. UMAR ISLAM Islam, 31, from Plaistow, east London, was a convert to Islam. He was formerly a Rastafarian. He changed his name from Brian Young and was employed as a bus conductor in London at the time of his arrest. He met Ali while working for an Islamic charity and travelled to refugee camps in Pakistan with Ali and Sarwar. He said he was planning to emigrate to Pakistan when arrested. He is married with two children, the second one being born after his arrest. The jury was unable to reach a verdict about Islam's role. However, he was found guilty of an alternative charge of conspiracy to murder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/190330","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-30T21:59:00Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Punjab, ISI and a distracted president trouble Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/190330","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/190330","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Punjab, ISI and a distracted president trouble Pakistan","bodyText":"Wednesday, 04 February 2009, 10:40 S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ISLAMABAD 000236 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/24/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, PTER, EAID, MARR, MOPS, PK SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SPECIAL ENVOY HOLBROOKE Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, for reasons 1.4 (b)(d) 1. (C) Summary. Mission Pakistan warmly welcomes your arrival; your appointment comes as Pakistan grapples with internal change and hopes the Ombama administration can support regional solutions to development and counter-terrorism challenges. After eight years of military rule, the civilian government is working, so far successfully, to re-shape civilian-military relations. Although not a failed state, Pakistan needs international help to stabilize civilian rule by building democratic institutions and delivering relief to a population suffering from food inflation, electricity blackouts, high unemployment and deteriorating law and order. Passage of the Kerry-Lugar bill and delivery of U.S. assistance at the upcoming IMF Donors' Conference offer new avenues to combat extremism inside and outside of the tribal areas and reduce anti-Americanism across Pakistan. 2. (S) Now absorbing combat losses against a formidable militant enemy, Pakistan's military finally has begun to accept more USG training and assistance in support of counter-insurgency. Pakistan-NATO/Afghan cooperation and coordination across the border has improved dramatically in recent months and will be even more important if the U.S. raises troop levels in Afghanistan. A surge of U.S. troops across the border may push more militants into Pakistan, creating new challenges especially if Pakistan must defend a new front in Balochistan. As recent media reports indicate, the U.S. has been remarkably successful over the past year in disrupting the al-Qaida network based in Pakistan's tribal areas; we can discuss this issue in greater detail with you. A friendly Zardari-Karzai relationship is creating new opportunities to improve cross-border trade and build an energy corridor that could eventually link Central and South Asia. Improved Pak-Afghan ties offer new prospects for outreach to Taliban reconcilables on both sides of the border. 3. (C) Indo-Pakistan relations are still simmering. In the wake of Mumbai and accelerating militant control of Pakistani territory, the military/ISI faces the need to re-evaluate its historic use of proxy tribes/militant groups as foreign policy tools. Although the conventional wisdom says that Mumbai closed the door on Kashmir discussions, there is no doubt that Pakistan believes tackling the Kashmir issue remains the key to regional security. We offer a detailed update below. End Summary Domestic Politics ----------------- 4. (C) The civilian government headed by President Asif Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Gilani, elected one year ago, is now stable. Zardari's position currently is secure, and Gilani has a majority in parliament. The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and its coalition allies rule in three of the four provinces and effectively control all three branches of federal government. Nawaz Sharif is by far the most popular politician in Pakistan (with an 83% approval rating compared to Zardari's 20% in the latest IRI poll), but he does not have the votes to bring down the government. Instead, Nawaz is rebuilding his party's structure in preparation for the next election and appealing directly to street. Zardari is cementing leadership alliances so he can avoid another election until he receives international assistance to address food and fuel inflation, electricity blackouts and high unemployment. 5. (C) While far from perfect, you will find Zardari is pro-American and anti-extremist; we believe he is our best ally in the government. Clearly, Zardari runs the show, and Gilani has at times chafed at public acknowledgment of this fact. We believe, however, that reports of Zardari-Gilani tensions are exaggerated; Gilani knows his place and will tow Zardari's line. 6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX The PPP may also make a power play to take over the Punjab government, which now is ruled by Shahbaz Sharif. During your visit you no doubt will ISLAMABAD 00000236 002 OF 005 hear rumors the Army is unhappy with Zardari and may step in to oust him, particularly if it is needed to restore order. 7. (C) The premise behind these rumors is that Nawaz-inspired street demonstrations timed to coincide with indirect Senate elections and another lawyers' \"Long March\" on March 9 may get out of hand. We see little evidence this scenario will get out of control; so far, we are encouraged by Chief of Army Staff General Kayani's determination to have the civilians succeed. Kayani dislikes Nawaz far more than he mistrusts Zardari. Not A Failed State ------------------ 8. (C) This is not a failed state. Pakistan has solid albeit weak institutions, a robust if often irresponsible media, established although under-equipped police forces, an increasingly strong civil society, and a population with a proven resiliency to withstand everything from earthquakes to kleptocracy. However, Zardari is more adept at political maneuvering than governing; we believe he is spending too much time on his rivalry with Nawaz and too little time on rolling back a spreading insurgency and improving a weak economy. 9. (C) Although we do not believe Pakistan is a failed state, we nonetheless recognize that the challenges it confronts are dire. The government is losing more and more territory every day to foreign and domestic militant groups; deteriorating law and order in turn is undermining economic recovery. The bureaucracy is settling into third-world mediocrity, as demonstrated by some corruption and a limited capacity to implement or articulate policy. Security -------- 10. (C) The good news is that the government has the will to fight extremism and the Army/Frontier Corps is now actively engaged in combat, particularly in Bajaur, Mohmand and Swat. Faced with its weaknesses against a formidable enemy, the Frontier Corps is now accepting USG training, and that is giving us new access and opportunities to improve Pakistani counter-insurgency capability. Pakistan has agreed to build additional tripartite Border Coordination Centers (BCCs), and this month we will expand tactical/target-focused intelligence sharing through the Torkham BCC. The military remains reluctant to expand the U.S. military footprint, but we now have the basis for increased cooperation. We are also delivering Cobra spare parts and upgrading their MI-17 and Bell 412 helicopters so the Pakistanis can operate more than two Cobras on any given day. 11. (C) The bad news is that the militants are driving the agenda; the Pakistan military has too few forces to fight too many battles at one time. They have more troops on the Indian border but felt the need to transfer 5,000-7,000 troops from FATA to the eastern border in the wake of increased Indo-Pak tensions after Mumbai. The latest territorial loss has been in Swat, in the \"settled area\" of the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) about 90 miles from Islamabad, where local/taliban militants are closing schools, beheading opponents, and operating a parallel justice system. The police cannot cope and largely have abandoned locals to their fate. 12. (C) The military's decision in 2008 to strike a deal with Baitullah Mehsud in South Waziristan helped to reduce the number of suicide bombings in Pakistan but gave Mehsud free rein to infiltrate his forces throughout the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). He has exploited Sunni-Shi'a tensions in places like Kurram and sent his fighters into Bajaur via Afghanistan to attack government positions. This has eroded Chief of Army Staff General Kayani's strategy to gradually regain control of the FATA agency by agency. 13. (S) As recent media reports indicate, the U.S. has been remarkably successful in disrupting al-Qaida operations in Pakistan's tribal areas. In the past year, 10 of the top 20 al-Qaida operatives, including those responsible for the East ISLAMABAD 00000236 003 OF 005 Africa embassy bombings in 1998 and tied to Islambad's Marriott bombing, have been eliminated. We can discuss this issue in more detail during your visit. Solutions --------- 14. (C) The government has a strategy of \"dialogue, deterrence and development;\" however, it lacks the military capacity to deter militants and the financial resources to develop the FATA. Its historic fallback has been to play for time by conducting negotiations with militants, a disastrous tactic that only has made the extremists stronger. The government insists it will negotiate with tribal leaders but not with militants. Many Pakistanis have been closely following reports of Saudi-brokered intervention with Taliban \"reconcilables\" in Afghanistan and many believe a similar strategy is needed in Pakistan. 15. (C) We share the government's belief that there is no all-military solution to containing extremism. We are implementing a strategy of concurrently building the counter-insurgency capability of the Army and Frontier Corps, providing the police/FATA law enforcement forces with training and equipment, and delivering economic development to raise poor socio-economic indicators in FATA. Security concerns are limiting our ability to operate, but today USAID contractors are building schools and wells, hiring workers for short-term jobs, training teachers and increasing the capacity of the FATA Secretariat to deliver services that demonstrate the writ of government in FATA. Through USAID, DOD and USG donations to UN agencies, we have provided over $10 million in aid to help up to 200,000 Internally Displaced Persons who fled fighting in Bajaur and Swat and now are living in and out of camps, primarily near Peshawar. 16. (C) Extremism, however, is no longer restricted to the border area. We are seeing young Punjabi men turn up in FATA and Afghanistan as fighters recruited from areas of southern Punjab where poverty, illiteracy and despair create a breeding ground for extremism. The phenomenon is spreading into northern Sindh as well. Pashtuns fleeing military action in FATA are destabilizing the always volatile ethnic mix in Karachi. Taliban leaders have been based in Quetta since the days of the anti-Soviet jihad, but they now are expanding their presence in Balochistan. In response, we are redirecting USAID programs geographically to concentrate on areas where the nexus of poverty and extremism is growing. 17. (SBU) Including FATA, USAID will program approximately $500 million in 2009 for Pakistan; if Kerry/Lugar is approved and funded, this will increase to $1.5 billion per year in primarily economic assistance. We have provided over $40 million in equipment to the Frontier Corps and the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) police; we are in the midst of programming another $15 million for the NWFP police and await the results of a police assessment team to reprogram another $85 million for law enforcement. Given the urgent requirement to address the absence of law enforcement capacity in the NWFP and FATA, we are proposing that $100 million for law enforcement assistance be included in the Kerry-Lugar legislation. Afghanistan ----------- 18. (C) Benazir Bhutto met with President Karzai the morning of her assassination; Karzai attended Zardari's inauguration and the two have met repeatedly under much improved bilateral relations. They have signed new economic cooperation agreements, are considering a new transit trade treaty and have tentatively scheduled another round of the peace jirga. We continue to see potential for expanded economic relations and the prospect of building a trade and energy corridor that can link Central Asia through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the rich markets of South Asia. 19. (C) Following embarrassing militant attacks on U.S./NATO convoys last year, Pakistan has made efforts to secure Khyber Agency/Torkham Gate, through which U.S./NATO trucks deliver 30% of the fuel and 80% of the dry goods for our forces in Afghanistan. Cooperation and coordination ISLAMABAD 00000236 004 OF 005 between Pakistani and NATO/Afghan forces across the border have dramatically increased since October. This has reduced cross-border attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan. This cooperation will be even more important if the U.S. executes a planned troop surge in Afghanistan. Such a surge, particularly if it is employed along the Helmand-Kandahar/Balochistan border, may send additional fighters into Pakistan and create another front for the Pakistan military to defend. India ----- 20. (C) Indo-Pak tensions are still simmering, but to avoid a potential Indian military strike, the GOP needs to show progress on prosecuting those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Interior Minister Malik will outline to you his plan to prosecute Lashkar-e-Taiba/Jamaat-ud-Dawa (LeT/JUD) suspects now in custody. The key will be whether the military/ISI is ready to turn the Mumbai suspects over to civilian law enforcement, and whether India considers Pakistani actions adequate. Kayani, in particular, wants to avoid a reckoning with his past leadership of ISI. Despite arrests of key LeT/JUD leaders and closure of some of their camps, it is unclear if ISI has finally abandoned its policy of using these proxy forces as a foreign policy tool; we need to continue pressing them to realize this strategy has become counter-productive in Kashmir, Afghanistan and FATA. 21. (C) The Foreign Ministry quashed National Assembly debate of a resolution signed by leaders of most of the political parties urging the U.S. to appoint a special envoy on Kashmir, or add that portfolio to your plate. However, privately, Zardari and FM Qureshi have indicated they would welcome your engagement on Kashmir. Although the conventional wisdom says that Mumbai closed the door on Kashmir discussions; from Pakistan's perspective, there is no doubt that tackling the Kashmir issue remains the key to regional security. Nukes ----- 22. (S) Strategic Plans Division Director LtGen (ret) Kidwai can brief you in detail on Pakistan's physical, personnel and command and control safeguards for Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Our major concern is not having an Islamic militant steal an entire weapon but rather the chance someone working in GOP facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon. Islamabad has chafed over the U.S.-India 123 Agreement, arguing it also needs civilian nuclear power to meet energy demand; we have repeatedly advised the GOP that it should not expect a similar agreement because of AQ Khan's proliferation activities. 23. (C) Khan, who now is suffering from cancer, remains a national hero, albeit one who is closely monitored under house arrest. In 2008, he tried and failed to win his freedom through the courts. His network, we believe, has been disbanded, and the U.S. recently imposed additional sanctions on Khan and two of his Khan Research Labs associates. Also worth noting is that China has reportedly agreed to help Pakistan build two additional civilian nuclear reactors, neither of which is grandfathered under Nuclear Supplier Group agreements. Neither project is expected to begin for at least five years, and we have expressed our concerns about this proposed deal to both China and Pakistan. Program of Record/F-16s ----------------------- 24. (C) DOD is requesting that Congress create a program of record for Pakistan, similar to that for Iraq and Afghanistan, which would provide consistent funding to implement our Security Development Plan (SDP), the vehicle we are using to train and equip both Pakistani Special Forces (SSG) and the Frontier Corps. Currently, DOD programs are delivered through a variety of separate funds with overlapping and sometimes conflicting authorities. The proposed DOD supplemental for Pakistan will total $400 million; the 2010 request will total $517 million. ISLAMABAD 00000236 005 OF 005 25. (C) The Bush administration commitment to provide Pakistan with $300 million annually in FMF expires in 2009, and we need to come to agreement with Pakistan on how to restructure its FMF program to meet its counter-insurgency needs. A major issue facing the new administration is whether to fund the remainder of Pakistan's F-16 program, a deal that was signed as a symbol of post-9/11 engagement after sanctions were lifted in 2002. 26. (C) Pakistan simply cannot afford to complete this $2 billion plus program to buy 18 new F-16s, upgrade 35 older Excess Defense Articles aircraft, upgrade a new base, and fund a munitions package. Pakistan has been late with several payments, and an Islamabad default would interrupt production lines for other critical U.S., Morocco and Turkey acquisitions. Pakistan originally planned to use the F-16s to offset Indian military superiority; they now are using F-16s against militant targets in the FATA. We are responding to Pakistan Air Force requests for Close Air Support training to improve their now limited precision targeting capability. Economy ------- 27. (C) Faced with untenable budgetary deficits, high inflation, and hemorrhaging foreign exchange reserves, the PPP government had little choice but to agree to an International Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement on November 24. This was regarded as an option of last resort, as no past Pakistani government had long survived the implementation of the fiscal austerity measures required by a Fund program. The $7.6 billion arrangement, with a $3.1 billion initial disbursement, has bought the GOP some breathing room, and appears to have somewhat restored market confidence. Foreign exchange reserves and the exchange rate have stabilized, and foreign remittances and direct investment are up slightly. Portfolio outflows continue, however, and the Karachi Stock Exchange remains moribund. 28. (C) While it appears that the GOP will be able to meet the IMF's first quarter targets, the higher interest rates imposed by the Fund, along with higher tax collection targets will make a full economic recovery more difficult. Although the GOP predicts 3 percent GDP growth, several experts predict a flat GDP for the fiscal year ending June 30. The reduction in government spending on social safety programs required by the IMF will not increase the government's popularity, while the elimination of all subsidies on electricity, which the GOP has promised by end-June, is particularly likely to stir popular anger. The severe electricity shortage has caused rolling blackouts throughout the country, and previous rate hikes have brought protesters into the streets. A looming wheat shortage has apparently been successfully avoided through the GOP's purchase of large amounts of Russian grain. 29. (C) The IMF has estimated that the GOP will need an additional $4 billion from donors over the next two years to strengthen the country's social safety net programs and beef up foreign exchange reserves. However, the GOP has never encouraged donor coordination and is having a difficult time coming up with lists of viable projects that donor countries would be likely to support. We understand that most donors are reluctant to provide the GOP with straight budgetary support. Pakistan will provide initial project ideas in February to ambassadors of the Friends of a Democratic Pakistan group; we will evaluate next steps, including a possible Friends ministerial on the margins of the Donors meeting, after receiving those proposals.

Though dubbed a \"long march\", the protests take the form of a motor convoy through the country. It is due to start in the south and culminate in a sit-in outside parliament in Islamabad on Monday.

But President Asif Zardari fears that if reinstated he could rescind Zardari's immunity from prosecution for old corruption charges. Why is the confrontation important? Pakistan matters. It is a nuclear power with a burgeoning domestic Islamist insurgency that poses a security risk not just for neighbouring Afghanistan and India, but for countries with historic social and cultural links such as Britain. The US and Britain would rather the country's leadership concentrated on fighting terrorism than each other. An alliance between the democrats following the 2007 assassination of Zardari's wife, Benazir Bhutto, proved all too brief. Analysts are concerned that if the democratic forces self-destruct, the military will step in once again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jun/26/nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-26T21:44:09Z","webTitle":"Fears for safety as nuclear watchdog hires staff from firms pitching to build reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/26/nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jun/26/nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Fears for safety as nuclear watchdog hires staff from firms pitching to build reactors","bodyText":"The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate is recruiting more than a dozen project managers to speed up its review of new reactor designs – even though they work for the companies hoping to build them. The Guardian has learnt that the government has approached companies including the US groups Bechtel and CH2M Hill, as well as the UK's Amec, to fill the senior posts. The companies involved are eager to secure lucrative contracts to help build the UK's first new reactors for decades. Government and industry sources admitted the secondments posed potential conflict of interest problems. It is also understood that the inspectorate has recruited technical staff from Areva, which has submitted one of the two reactor designs for approval. One nuclear source said staff from the French firm, which is partnered with EDF, would not be allowed to work on Areva's reactor design and insisted they would be \"technologically neutral\". There are concerns that the potential conflicts of interest could compromise the safety of the new nuclear reactors if the companies helping the inspectorate have a vested interest in approving their design. The inspectorate has resorted to recruiting managers from the industry it regulates because previous attempts to fill the posts have been unsuccessful. Government officials also believe the body, which has been plagued by staff shortages for years, lacks the commercial and technical expertise to oversee the construction of a new generation of nuclear reactors. The work to test the two designs – from Areva and Westinghouse, owned by Toshiba – is already behind schedule. The inspectorate hopes new project managers will enable it to accelerate the process so it can complete the work by the middle of 2011 as originally envisaged. Nuclear companies are becoming increasingly nervous about the inspectorate's ability to handle the work and fear it could delay the construction of new reactors. There are also concerns that groups opposed to nuclear power, such as Greenpeace, could mount a legal challenge against the inspection process if it is flawed. One government source familiar with the nuclear industry said: \"In any outsourcing in government departments, particularly in those of a regulatory nature, there is always the possibility of a conflict of interest. But the NII has used outside advisers before.\" Emma Gibson, senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \"The NII is supposed to be independent. It's inevitable that there will be bias in the system if you are going to hire people from the nuclear industry. There will be safety concerns if the idea is to rush through the reactor design assessment programme.\" She said Greenpeace had been urging the government to provide the inspectorate with more resources to fill its vacancies. A spokesman for the NII did not confirm which companies had been approached but said: \"The NII has taken on a number of specialist contractors to support both our assessment teams and also to improve our project management capability – this is not unusual. In all cases, the selection process and contractual arrangements we have in place are designed to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest. \"Although we have brought in people from outside the organisation to support our work, as independent regulators we make all regulatory decisions.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212446","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-28T18:13:37Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Washington calls for intelligence on 'Bulgarian government corruption'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212446","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212446","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Washington calls for intelligence on 'Bulgarian government corruption'","bodyText":"Tuesday, 16 June 2009, 21:39 S E C R E T STATE 062392 NOFORN EO 12958 DECL: 06/16/2034 TAGS PINR, KSPR, ECON, BU SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: BULGARIA REF: STATE 18756 Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS.

Back in 1974, Teddy Goldsmith fought a general election on behalf of \"People\", which later became the Green party. Searching for an eye-catching way of highlighting the issue of soil erosion in East Anglia, Teddy led a camel on a lead bearing the slogan: \"No deserts in Suffolk. Vote Goldsmith.\" Perhaps unsurprisingly, he lost his deposit. Thirty five years later, his nephew, Zac Goldsmith, parliamentary candidate for the Conservative party in Richmond Park, is unlikely to lose his deposit, and he has chosen a more orthodox method of promoting his ideas. His new book, The Constant Economy, sets out 10 steps which the government must take to \"restore balance to our relationship with the world around us\". For Goldsmith, a \"constant economy\" is one in which resources are valued, food is grown sustainably and goods are built to last. It is a system which recognises nature's limits, where energy security is based on renewable resources and strong communities are valued as the most effective protection against social, economic and environmental instability. Each chapter elaborates on one of the 10 steps, and offers inspiring examples of where solutions are already being practised (frustratingly without footnotes or references). Yet for a book nominally about the economy, Goldsmith has surprisingly little to say about economics. In spite of its title, the book doesn't draw on the ground-breaking work of Herman Daly and his development of \"steady state economics\", nor does it go as far as the Sustainable Development Commission's equally ground-breaking recent report, Prosperity Without Growth. Rather, it repeats the well-trodden ground of the limits to GDP and the importance of alternative economic indicators, perhaps reflecting in its reluctance to enter deeper into the economics debate his own ambivalence about the role of the market. Caricaturing the green movement as having \"fractured\" into \"lighter\" greens, who promote green consumerism, and \"darker\" greens, who promote \"alarm, pessimism and disenchantment\", he criticises the latter for believing that \"we are faced with a choice between the economy and ecology.\" Yet that's not what most greens, dark or otherwise, believe. The choice, rather, is between a steady state economy, in balance with our wider environment, or an economy based on endless economic growth, which is likely to destroy our environment, yet which continues to be promoted by all three of the larger parties. And while it is certainly true that, in the past, the green movement has not spent enough time promoting the benefits of a post-carbon economy, if he really thinks that most greens deliberately identify \"the hardest, most punitive solutions, and when they describe the challenge, it is invariably insurmountable\", then he's spending too much time with the wrong people. The 10 steps which Goldsmith describes are certainly good ones, but I'm not sure we can let him off the hook for the issues he chooses not to address – population growth, for one. To his credit, he acknowledges that it \"deserves a chapter to itself\", but he declines to give it one because \"this book is about solutions, and there are not obvious or ethically acceptable solutions to population growth\". At a time when millions of women in the south are desperate for the means to control their own fertility, and when governments in the north are perversely giving incentives to women to have larger families, this seems an odd conclusion to draw. Electoral reform is another issue conspicuous by its absence. Goldsmith boldly announces that we need \"radical and urgent reform of our political system ... to galvanise the people and rejuvenate democracy\", yet the one reform which would make the most difference is absent. Localism is promoted instead. Yet while popular referenda and recall systems are useful ways of generating greater engagement in the political process, to ignore the need for a fairer voting system seems perverse. Throughout the book, Goldsmith builds a compelling case that the solutions to the environmental crisis exist, and all it requires is the political will to implement them. I agree – but is David Cameron's Conservative party likely to oblige? Presumably Goldsmith believes it will – or he wouldn't have chosen to be a Conservative candidate. But while I admire his optimism, it's hard to find much justification for it, when measured against the way most Tory politicians actually behave. Take his MEP colleagues: on just about all of the very sensible proposals Goldsmith makes – proposals which, I can't resist pointing out, are championed by the Greens – Conservative members have consistently voted against. Whether it's promoting a zero-waste strategy and higher emission standards for cars, for example, or a moratorium on all aviation expansion and a rejection of nuclear power, his Tory colleagues are stubbornly opposed to progress. Despite all of this, The Constant Economy is a compelling read, and inspiring in its positive, solution-oriented focus. Whether Goldsmith will be given the latitude to pursue this agenda if the Conservatives win the next election is another question."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212448","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-02T19:40:01Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: US diplomats in Romania asked to compile 'biometric' data on 'current and emerging leaders and advisors'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212448","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/212448","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: US diplomats in Romania asked to compile 'biometric' data on 'current and emerging leaders and advisors'","bodyText":"Tuesday, 16 June 2009, 21:45 S E C R E T STATE 062395 NOFORN EO 12958 DECL: 06/16/2034 TAGS PINR, KSPR, ECON, RO SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: ROMANIA REF: STATE 18770 Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS.

(S) Summary: HFAC staffers Richard Kessler and David Fite received from IAEA Secretariat November 10 information on the Iran case that tracked with the tone of the subsequent Director General's reporting on Iran to the Board of Governors. The STAFFDEL heard that contact with Iran over \"possible military dimensions\" of the nuclear program was at an \"absolute stalemate.\" According to Safeguards regional division director Herman Nackaerts, IAEA inspectors' first visit to the enrichment facility under construction near Qom had run predictably but without extraordinary responsiveness on Iran's part; the Secretariat was still trying to understand the motivation to build the plant as now designed. Nackaerts described the frustrating limitations of Iran's cooperation with the Agency, and the STAFFDEL deduced that Iranian officials held back because they were uncertain about what lines of inquiry the IAEA was best equipped to exploit. Questioning then-DG ElBaradei's remark to media that the Agency had found \"nothing to worry about\" in Qom, STAFFDEL asked if the Secretariat would report on how it judged the plant did or did not fit into Iran's publicly explained nuclear program. Nackaerts expressed appreciation for the precision and usefulness of U.S.-supplied information in the Qom case and generally. 2. (C) Summary contd.: On Syria, Nackaerts said the Secretariat had told Damascus its first explanation for the presence of anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor was not credible. Further, the Secretariat still could not yet present the case for how what was being built at Dair Alzour fit in as \"part of a Syrian program or part of someone else's program.\" On DPRK, IAEA/EXPO's Tariq Rauf said the IAEA, when it could, would ultimately have to \"go back to the early 1990s\" to reconstruct accountancy of plutonium and could not accept a \"political\" compromise setting material \"off to the side.\" To get to a finding of \"no diversion\" would take several years and extensive resources and forensics. 3. (SBU) Contd.: Treating Technical Cooperation, the STAFFDEL received the same briefing on the Safeguards Department's project review process and internal database that was provided to a GAO review team in 2008. IAEA External Relations Director Rauf asserted, \"We are not a denial organization.\" STAFFDEL related how segments of the GAO report had reduced Congressional confidence in the efficiency of TC. U.S. national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decision-making on their merit and proliferation risk. Secretariat also described hindrances it faces in having UN and national development officials recognize and integrate nuclear applications. 4. (SBU) Contd.: The STAFFDEL also engaged P5-plus-1 heads of mission over lunch on the means to draw or impel Iran to open up on its nuclear program and on dynamics in Vienna between blocs of Member States. End Summary. Fordow/Qom and Iran PMD: Frustration, but Good Support from the U.S. ------------------------------------- 5. (U) House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Majority Staff Director Richard Kessler and Professional Staff Member David Fite (STAFFDEL) spent ninety minutes with IAEA staff on November 10. Principal issues were safeguards verification in Iran and Syria, the screening of IAEA Technical Cooperation (TC) projects for proliferation risk, and TC Department efforts to improve project design and integration into national and UN development activities. STAFFDEL affirmed to Secretariat officials that the HFAC under Chairman Berman: was strongly supportive of the IAEA; put emphasis on counter-proliferation issues in countries of concern (indeed, was weighing legislation to impose further U.S. sanctions on Iran); had advocated an increase in NADR funding for extrabudgetary contributions to the IAEA, including for the Safeguards Analytical laboratory; and, supported \"getting the U.S. up to date\" on payment of its assessments to the IAEA's regular budget. Following the meeting at the IAEA, STAFFDEL consulted Ambassador and Mission staff and had a working lunch with P5-plus-1 heads of mission focused on Iran and the dynamics of multilateral UNVIE VIEN 00000540 002 OF 005 diplomacy in Vienna. STAFFDEL's UNVIE program followed a day of consultations with Austrian officials (reftel). 6. (SBU) IAEA Safeguards Department Operations B (AOR Mideast, South Asia, parts of Europe, the Americas, and all nuclear weapons states) Director Herman Nackaerts briefed STAFFDEL on the inspection he had led a few weeks before to the recently disclosed Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant near Qom in Iran. Nackaerts said Iranian officials had been open to allowing inspectors access. The Secretariat was still trying to understand, he said, why Iran would build this facility, scaled as it was for 3000 centrifuges in contrast to the much large Natanz facility. It was positive, Nackaerts pointed out, that Fordow was now under safeguards. He noted that the IAEA had \"at least two\" safeguards inspectors at work in Iran \"every day of the year\" and would henceforth plan to visit Fordow regularly. Asked how \"complete\" the plant was or when it would be operational, Nackaerts said, \"The information we got from Member States proved to be very precise\" on this point. Asked about permission to take samples at Fordow, Nackaerts replied that Iranian officials had permitted the inspectors to perform the same safeguards procedures they typically undertook at Natanz. 7. (S) STAFFDEL asked if the Agency enjoyed full access to the Arak IR-40 plant. Nackaerts related there had been no access for a 12-month period but normal access in August and October 2009. However, the Iranians \"claim they cannot go back on the decision of their parliament, and hence grant the IAEA a \"visit\" but do not call it Design Information Verification. On possible military dimensions (PMD), Nackaerts said the Secretariat's approach was to follow lines of inquiry that could involve use of nuclear material, for example, the documents treating uranium metal or green salt. The Iranians, he said in a tone conveying his skepticism, asserted the uranium metal document was \"mistakenly\" included in a packet of information they received from the AQ Khan network but was nothing Iran had asked for or used. The \"green salt\" documentation Iran dismissed as a forgery. Indeed, Nackaerts went on, Iran replied basically on the form of documents, not on their substance. The Secretariat had not been \"impressed\" by the 117-page rejoinder Iran had provided to the initial presentation of PMD documentation. It had told Iran the information hung together too much for it all to have bee fabricated and asked that, if some of the documentation were \"doctored,\" Iranian officials should show the Secretariat \"where the truth ends.\" Since August 2008, (when Ahmadinejad personally shut off Nackaerts's previously approved visit to workshops indicated in the documentation), Nackaerts concluded, there remained a high-level decision not to cooperate. STAFFDEL member Fite took from this that the Iranians were holding back \"because they don't know where any opening will lead.\" Nackaerts agreed, saying they knew that every question they answered would bring another question. 8. (S) Fite alluded to then-DG ElBaradei's remarks of a few days before in U.S. media to the effect that the inspectors had found \"nothing to worry about\" in Fordow. Acknowledging the practical meaning of this remark -- that there were no centrifuges or nuclear material present -- Fite nevertheless regretted the headline and asked if the DG's formal report to Board members (Note: subsequently released as GOV/2009/74, deresticted by the Board November 27, and available to the public at www.iaea.org) would deal with how Qom fits or does not fit into Iran's explained nuclear program. Nackaerts replied, \"We will identify the issues we're working.\" He went on that understanding the timeline of Fordow's development was hindered by Iran's practice never to involve people who really know the facts or the government's intentions in discussion with the Agency. The officials with whom inspectors meet clearly are \"steered\" by unseen observers, who send notes to the Iranian interlocutors during meetings. Iran recorded the meetings, he added, but did not permit the IAEA to do so. Further, the Secretariat never received original design documents, but ones produced for the Secretariat that were technically true to the facilities they found upon inspection. Against this Iranian practice, Nackaerts added, the Secretariat received very precise information from Member States that helped inspectors decide what to ask about. The organization of this information was good and, while the Agency was satisfied, it had inquired if more information could be shared with the Agency, \"not necessarily for release to Iran,\" he said. Syria Stalemate UNVIE VIEN 00000540 003 OF 005 --------------- 9. (SBU) The Syria case, Nackaerts said, was starting to look like Iran in that the government provided \"good cooperation\" on some areas but presented a \"stalemate\" on others. The Secretariat challenged Syria's proposed explanation for the presence of uranium at Dair Alzour/Al Kibar (i.e., that Israeli depleted uranium munitions could be the source), but the inquiry was at a roadblock. Syrian officials had been told their first explanation for anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) was not credible, and the Agency had inquired what nuclear material Syria could have had that was not previously declared. Overall, the IAEA still \"did not understand\" (meaning, it could not yet present the solid case for) how Dair Alzour fit in as part of a Syrian nuclear program \"or part of someone else's program.\" Return to DPRK? Safeguards in India? -------------------- 10. (SBU) Asked how quickly IAEA inspectors could resume work in North Korea if re-admitted by the government, Tariq Rauf of IAEA External Relations and Policy Coordination (EXPO) observed that the last resumption had taken a week (for technical set-up, re-activation of cameras, etc.). Safeguards Operations A division had a program set out for what steps to undertake \"under circumstances the DPRK may let us back in.\" Rauf continued that the Agency would to go back to the early 1990s' plutonium revelation to reconstruct material accountancy. When most recently in the DPRK, the IAEA had been monitoring facility shutdown processes but not implementing NPT safeguards on DPRK material. The Agency could \"not accept\" political compromises that would set some nuclear material \"off to the side\". Then-DG ElBaradei had called for implementation of the Additional Protocol in DPRK, but even if Pyongyang cooperated fully it would take several years and much in the way of resources and forensics to be able to get to a finding of \"no diversion.\" 11. (SBU) Asked about progress toward safeguards implementation in India, Rauf confirmed the GOI had submitted a \"formal list\" of facilities that was not a document the Agency would characterize as a formal declaration under its safeguards agreement. India was under no mandatory timeline to make its declaration as it was not an NPT signatory. (Comment: Rauf's characterization was flat wrong. Mission had learned from the Safeguards Department three weeks before this meeting that India had officially \"notified\" two new facilities (Raps 5 and 6) under its 2008 safeguards agreement, that surveillance systems had been installed, and the facilities were under safeguards. End Comment.) Scrutinizing and Promoting IAEA Technical Cooperation -------------------------- 12. (U) Renaud Chatelus of the Safeguards Division of Information Management (SGIM) acquainted STAFFDEL with IAEA screening of Technical Cooperation (TC) projects for their potential to afford access to sensitive technologies. Grounded in a 1979 Agency Information Circular, INFCIRC/267, the practice is to focus on projects related to enrichment, heavy water production, reprocessing of spent fuel, and plutonium or mixed oxide fuel. Chatelus said SGIM reviewed projects submitted, project approved, individual procurement actions, and overall implementation of projects. Reviews are conducted completely in-house, he said in reply to a question. Using the same PowerPoint slides that were presented to a GAO review team in 2008, Chatelus illustrated with screen shots from the Agency's staff access-only database the system of flagging projects for: compliance with INFCIRC 267, compliance with INFCIRC 540 (Additional Protocol), transfer of \"sensitive items\" on the Nuclear Suppliers Group or dual-use lists, general interest, or possible relation to a safeguarded facility. In subsequent discussion of the impact of screening and Member States' sense of entitlement to TC, EXPO's Tariq Rauf affirmed, \"We are not a denial organization.\" 13. (U) STAFFDEL member Fite observed that segments of the GAO report treating transfers to state sponsors of terrorism as well as on program management had reduced Congressional confidence about TC. Fite said he had approached Appropriations staff about using a supplemental funding bill UNVIE VIEN 00000540 004 OF 005 to resolve slow U.S. payment of assessments and do more for the Agency, but was rebuffed because the GAO report on TC had \"poisoned the waters.\" Apart from political objections to certain TC recipients benefitting from U.S. funding, he added, a persisting \"Achilles heel\" was that U.S. national labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our national decision-making on their merit and proliferation risk. TC Department representative Johannes Seybold replied that the Agency aimed to provide Member States six weeks time for review, but was also at the mercy of requesting states providing the relevant project information. Just the compendium of project titles and short descriptions became a very thick document in each biennial cycle, Seybold went on, and the Agency was \"struggling\" with some Member States' national policies to be able to go beyond this level of transparency. 14. (U) STAFFDEL's meeting with Secretariat officials concluded in an exchange with Seybold, TC's section head for strategy and partnerships, about the IAEA's awkward position in development efforts coordinated by the UN or by developing countries' national institutions. Seybold laid out the following. The IAEA's cooperation with TC recipient states occurs through National Liaison Officers, generally in the atomic energy commission or government ministry responsible for nuclear power or radiological sources. Generally, neither the IAEA nor the corresponding national entity is a participant in UN development team or host government deliberations about development in the recipient country. Two-thirds of TC projects address development issues for which the IAEA is not the responsible lead agency in the UN system, e.g., water quality and availability, food security, climate. In many cases, national authorities and the UN team responsible for these areas in a given country lack awareness of IAEA capabilities, and/or they maintain a distance from things \"nuclear.\" Seybold related Agency efforts to integrate with these authorities through the UNDAF (UN Development Assistance Framework) process and other partnering efforts. STAFFDEL expressed encouragement for bringing nuclear applications to greater impact in the development field. P5-plus-1 Ambassadors Regret Iranian Paralysis on TRR; Depict Grim Dynamic with G-77/NAM --------------------------------------------- - 15. (C) STAFFDEL was the guests of honor at lunch hosted by the Ambassador with his counterparts from China, Germany, Russia, and the UK and the French Charge d'Affaires. Kessler and Fite laid out HFAC's interest and Chairman Berman's supportive posture toward the Agency, as they had for Secretariat staff. Opening discussion of Iran, UK Ambassador Simon Smith said the Iranian answer on the ElBaradei-brokered deal on refueling the Tehran research reactor (TRR) \"had to be 'yes' or 'no,' not waffling\" as it had been. German Ambassador Ruediger Luedeking posited that the U.S. Administration had confounded Iranian internal processes and the latest EU3 proposal had \"cornered\" Iran. Agreeing that Iran faced an imperative between \"yes\" and \"no,\" Luedeking observed, \"they can't answer.\" HFAC Staff Director Kessler noted the committee had tried to follow up a Larijani approach conveyed one year before for a meeting with Chairman Berman, but found that the Iranians backed off. 16. (C) Russian Ambassador Alexander Zmeyevskiy asserted that confidentiality was a major concern for Iran. He noted its TRR counter-proposals, either to keep its LEU on its territory under IAEA safeguards until released in exchange for fuel rods, or to swap outgoing LEU piecemeal for incoming fuel assemblies. Moving beyond the TRR issue, UK Ambassador said he was severely disappointed that Member States had been unable to \"apply consequences for the breaking of rules\" of the organization. We needed to convince some other Member States, he continued, that tolerating rule breaking as on Qom and Code 3.1 (of the Subsidiary Arrangement of Iran's Safeguards Agreement) risked bringing the organization into discredit. STAFFDEL member Fite asked if Iran's Arab neighbors were among the problem interlocutors in Vienna; he asserted that officials of Arabian Peninsula countries told the Congress they see Iran as an \"existential threat.\" While they may seek the cover of international signals or sanctions imposed by others, they say they do want action against Iran. 17. (C) Segueing from Iran to DPRK, Chinese Ambassador Hu Xiaodi said the main difference between the cases was that progress with DPRK had been achieved when the North Koreans UNVIE VIEN 00000540 005 OF 005 wanted something specific, whereas he (Hu) had never heard Iranian officials say that they wanted a settlement, or that they wanted anything specific. Although we did not at present know \"how\" to reach a deal with Iran, Hu concluded, we were not in the worst situation, in which Iran explicitly does want something -- nuclear weapons. Asked if he genuinely thought the DPRK would give up its weapons program for aid, Hu said \"hope\" (as opposed to \"think.\") Ambassador Davies seriously questioned that Pyongyang would give up a weapons capability in exchange for a significant material improvement in our relations, as the government would likely calculate it had been its possession of weapons that won the concessions. 18. (SBU) Ambassador turned the discussion to the dynamic between groups of Member States, as illustrated in the ongoing discussion of a Technical Cooperation project to advance IAEA use of \"results based management.\" The German Ambassador observed that NAM positions on many issues were characterized by \"myths\" and they were clearly being dictated by Iran and Egypt. Ambassador Davies asked if the dynamic was further charged by states beginning to suspect that the U.S. seriously intends to strengthen the Agency in all its functions -- with the uncertain shifts in practice and distribution of resources and clout that could mean. STAFFDEL lead Kessler said the Congressional perception was one of a \"lightning change\" from the last Administration to the present one in U.S. approaches to the IAEA, to development assistance globally, and to multilateralism. German Ambassador agreed and said this was a complication for NAM states that know they are the immobile ones now. Yet, TC was a \"sacred cow\" and the NAM's impulse was to reject \"illegitimate intrusion\" into its distribution. 19. (SBU) French Charge Philippe Merlin discouraged STAFFDEL from expecting diplomatic gains, say in the NPT review, through greater generosity on IAEA peaceful use programs. \"TC is the price we pay,\" he said, for developing countries' acquiescence toward the safeguards regime, the thing we really want. Fite asked if a reasoned discussion with development officials in capitals about making TC deliver more impact could translate into different instructions to the obstreperous missions in Vienna. German Ambassador took the view that any effort to change TC would be seen in capitals as \"per se bad.\" It was more advisable to advocate to NAM states what their own interests in the safeguards regime were. UK Ambassador agreed there were no points to be scored by asking NAM capitals about TC effectiveness; he added that the UK Government \"doesn't give two hoots\" about TC, given the small funding level (from the UK Energy Ministry) in comparison to Britain's official development assistance. TC was, also in the UK view, the price we pay for the IAEA we want. 20. (U) STAFFDEL did not review this report. DAVIES"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
